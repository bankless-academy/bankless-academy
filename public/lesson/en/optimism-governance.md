# Old Problems, New Tools

Modern technology has drastically changed the way in which humans view and interact with each other. On the world stage, and in a borderless cyberspace, we need new coordination models in order to coexist and thrive as a global tribe.

The vision of `DAO` technology is to greatly streamline problem solving and debate between multiple parties — whether on the internet, in your local community, or on an international scale. This is done by:

- Incentivizing participants to share a common mission.
- Innovative vote, delegate, and veto mechanics.
- Using blockchain technology to increase the difficulty of human error or attack.

# The Optimism Network

`DAOs` like the `Optimism Network` are at the frontier of exploring such coordination systems. 

In this lesson, we will explore how Optimism (OP) is pioneering the DAO vision. We will learn about their mission, and how they’re building new frameworks for human coordination in order to achieve it.

Our quest will focus on claiming our first voting rights, so we’re ready to help build the future of Ethereum, and human coordination!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/the-optimism-network-d43cccdf.svg)

# Network **Governance**

Like any real world nation-state with resources and participants, a `DAO` hosts a governance process to steer the deployment of its resources and achievement of its mission. This process is called `onchain governance`: a series of online proposals, community discussions, and votes. It’s like a townhall, but `asynchronous`, global, and mediated by code.

On Ethereum, onchain governance can serve a variety of functions, like choosing network upgrades, responding to economic challenges, protecting the network from attack, or improving the governance process itself! Onchain governance allows a network to evolve while staying true to its shared mission.

With many blockchain networks still in their early days, todays voices are extremely high impact in deciding the future of online communities tomorrow.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/network-governance-ec1d1abb.svg)

# Knowledge Check 1

How can onchain governance help to solve interhuman debate?

- [ ] By providing automated coordination systems that evolve based on shared human feedback.

> ℹ️ 

- [ ] Through transparent, attack-resistant voting processes.

> ℹ️ 

- [ ] By hosting an opt-in, mission-oriented community for people across the world.

> ℹ️  

- [ ] All of the above.

> ℹ️  

# **The Optimistic Vision**

Optimism is on a mission to scale Ethereum by building a `Layer 2` network — a place with lower fees, faster transactions, and Ethereum’s high standard of security. Here’s what it looks like:

⚒️ **Free Market:** The OP Network was launched as an extension of not just Ethereum `blockspace`, but of Ethereum principles. It aims to scale the permissionless, open-source, censorship-resistant marketplace of Ethereum. 

🏕️ **Public Goods:** OP puts great emphasis on funding and building onchain `public goods`. These are free-to-access, infinite resources & facilities available to all network citizens. Your free education at Bankless Academy has been made possible through Optimism’s public goods grants ecosystem!

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Community Governance:** Governance is commanded by the community, structured for iterative growth. OP uses a seasonal governance format, giving opportunity for the community to digest, reflect on, and discuss the previous events and iterations of governance.

The ecosystem is a capitalist district of cyberspace that directly provides for, and is governed by, its citizens!

# Knowledge Check 2

What definition best fits a ‘public good’?

- [ ] An unlimited good shared amongst a specific group of people.

> ℹ️ Try again! This defines a private, infinite good, like a cinema or toll road.

- [ ] A public resource that cannot run out.

> ℹ️ Correct! This defines a public, infinite good, like software or knowledge.

- [ ] Free, limited access to a public service.

> ℹ️ Try again! This defines a public, finite service, like socialized healthcare.

# Progressive Decentralization

Many great blockchain projects begin with a centralized group and vision. This gives the project crucial focus in building and spending, but a global community needs more than promises of eventual decentralization to truly be a DAO.

On OP, the founder and community groups are thought of as follows:

- **Optimism Foundation:** The network founders, steward of the Collective. They run governance experiments, provide initial resources, build partnerships, and start the ecosystem.
- **Optimism Collective:** The governing community; a diverse set of global participants. They are responsible for the long term ownership and management of the ecosystem.

There are legal checks and balances, such as the Collective’s ability to remove members of the Foundation. This ensures slow transfer of network ownership to the community, before the Foundation eventually dissolves.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/progressive-decentralization-d2955246.svg)

# Knowledge Check 3

True or false?

The Optimism Foundation will continue to guide the Optimism Collective over the network’s lifetime.

- [ ] True

> ℹ️ …

- [ ] False

> ℹ️ …

# A New **Economy**

At the heart of the Optimism `L2` economy is the Optimistic flywheel. This economic cycle generates revenue, network growth, and the achievement of the Optimistic mission.

1. Users and `dApps` demand network `blockspace`.
2. The network generates revenue via transaction fees.
3. A portion of these taxes are distributed to builders providing impactful public goods infrastructure.
4. Everyone gains access to free resources & services.

With more valuable onchain infrastructure, demand for OP blockspace increases, and the cycle continues!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/a-new-economy-2981ffe5.png)

# **Incentivizing** **Public Goods**

For a project to be considered for public goods funding, OP takes an ‘**Impact = Profit**’ approach. Impact, however, is difficult to anticipate ahead of time. Rather than making predictions, the funding body periodically look over existing projects and assign retroactive funding based on historic performance. As Vitalik Buterin said, 

_“It’s easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful.”_

This distribution model is known as ‘Retroactive Public Goods Funding’, or ‘RetroPGF’. This funding mechanism incentivises optimistic thinkers to build public goods that are of service to humanity — free from the value-extraction mindset of traditional free markets. OP calls this effect ‘**Ether’s Phoenix**’, an “angel reaching backwards in time, rewarding those who summon it.”

_“It is an algorithm that rewards the early cooperators who created conditions for public goods funding to prosper. It is a future where early investment in public goods is recognized. It is also a mindset: that optimism prevails, that better systems are possible, and that humankind will be rewarded for its cooperative revolution.”_

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/incentivizing-public-goods-adc49d00.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

How is Optimism incentivizing community-focused economics?

- [ ] By rewarding all Optimism projects with retroactive funding.

> ℹ️ Try again! Rewarding all projects regardless of their mission 

- [ ] By providing a free market, but on the blockchain.

> ℹ️ Try again! Use of blockchain technology alone doesn’t effect economic models.

- [ ] By systemically funding business models that improve the lives of all network users.

> ℹ️ Correct! The network allocates a portion of transaction fees towards funding public goods.

- [ ] All of the above.

> ℹ️  Try again! One of these is untrue.

# Introducing the Governing Houses

There are two houses in OP governance, with independent and shared responsibilities in directing the network. 

**The Token House** is responsible for managing network upgrades, incentives, and the treasury. It uses a stakeholder structure to incentivize growth of the network economy, and accrue stakeholder value. The house is also responsible for preserving decentralization — preventing capture of the network economy.

**The Citizens’ House** allocates `RetroPGF` resources to community projects, according to the ‘Impact = Profit’ ethos, and helps to decide the parameters of citizenship. The house is incentivized to improve network quality-of-life, by funding public goods that improve the value of citizenship!

Both houses maintain network balance through specific duties, voting mechanics, and `veto` abilities. You can join either house, or both! Let’s take a closer look at their functions.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/introducing-the-governing-houses-992f67be.png)

# Knowledge Check 5

How does the Citizens’ House differ from the Token House?

- [ ] The Citizens’ House is the only house with veto abilities.

> ℹ️ Try again! Both houses can veto certain proposals made by the other house.

- [ ] The Citizens’ House allocates RetroPGF rewards.

> ℹ️ Correct! The primary role of the Citizens’ House is public goods funding.

- [ ] The Citizens’ House leads network decentralization.

> ℹ️  …

- [ ] All of the above.

> ℹ️  Try again!

# The Token House

The Token House maintains the economy and defenses of the OP Network. 

Duties include:

- ⚒️ Review and approval of **upgrades to network mechanics**.
- ⛓️ Selection of network **block producers**.
- 📈 **Allocation of revenue,** using collected transaction fees to fuel network growth.

The Citizens’ House has the right to veto any proposal under the above categories.

The Token house also has the ability to veto any proposal submitted by the Citizens’ House, or the Optimism Foundation, seen to be **reducing rights** of tokenholders.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/the-token-house-6d73a8ae.svg)

# Token House: Joining, Voting, Delegating

Joining the Token House is done via purchasing and holding OP tokens, with voting power scaling based on how many tokens are held. These are ERC20 tokens, and are therefore transferrable; They can be bought and sold on `CEXs`, an Optimism `DEX`, or sent between friends. OP tokens are not available on other networks.

With this considered, some users prefer to delegate their voting power to community members — known as Governance Delegates — that they feel best represent the community’s interests. This is a great way to have an impact on the ecosystem without having to read every proposal that enters voting. Delegating doesn’t require a user to give up ownership of their tokens!

Anyone can become a Token House delegate on Optimism, representing a group of friends, a community, or even a university’s blockchain club! Large, active delegates are often rewarded by the community.

Now, network governance is only as democratic as its initial `token distribution` — meaning who received voting power in the first place. Check out the [OP distribution plan](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/#allocations-at-a-glance) to see how Optimism has divided initial governance power, in service of balanced community representation.

# Knowledge Check 6

How does the Token House protect the network from governance capture?

- [ ] By selecting a diverse set of network block producers.

> ℹ️ …

- [ ] By vetoing Optimism Foundation proposals seen to be reducing token holder rights.

> ℹ️ …

- [ ] Through decentralized token distribution.

> ℹ️  …

- [ ] All of the above.

> ℹ️  …

# The Citizens’ House

The Citizens’ House conducts the growth of public infrastructure on the Optimism Network.

Duties include:

- 🎯 **Defining RetroPGF metrics and impact** criteria for measuring project performance.
- 🔍 **Research and allocation of RetroPGF** to community projects meeting the set guidelines.
- 👬 **Selection of new citizens** to help govern the Citizens’ House, and balance Token House perspective. The Token House has veto rights for this type of proposal

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/the-citizens-house-fd4eef9e.svg)

# Citizens’ House: Joining, Voting, Delegating

New joiners to the Citizen House are currently onboarded by invitation, to slowly scale and refine the House’s process. Membership is marked by holding a Citizen Badge — a nontransferable `ERC-721` token.

Invitation can happen in a number of ways, but specific scaling methods have been known to change season to season:

- Citizen badgeholders may be granted an additional invite, to be shared with someone they deem of great benefit to the network.
- Previous recipients of RetroPGF have been granted the opportunity to select one community member for Citizen status.
- The Optimism Foundation has issued badges to project builders using the network.

Each badgeholder has a single vote. Their voting power is non-transferrable, and cannot be delegated, in order to prevent accumulation of House power under a small number of citizens.

# Knowledge Check 7

How does the Citizens’ House protect the network from governance capture?

- [ ] By expanding the number of Citizens’ House members.

> ℹ️ 

- [ ] By vetoing Token House proposals seen to be leading to power imbalance.

> ℹ️ 

- [ ] Both of the above.

> ℹ️  

# Now… Think Even Bigger!

We’re almost ready to get involved in OP governance. There’s one last thing to mention.

The OP vision doesn’t stop at a single `L2` blockchain. As result of the ability to `fork` a blockchain, this is a cloneable governance experiment. OP technology is built to be scaled across multiple L2s — and even into real world governance scenarios. OP calls it **the Superchain**.

Coinbase haw already cloned and begun contributing to this shared `open source` initiative, through the Base blockchain. This collaborative pooling of development resources increases infrastructure evolution, while funneling L2 transaction fees towards OP’s impact=profit ethos.

Members are required to abide by the OP governance process to continue their benefits. This sets an exciting economic vision, if we can build sustainable, community-oriented governance practices today!

# Shaping an Optimistic Future

History has always been paved by the optimists of humanity — those that dared to think big, and act to achieve it.

By getting involved in innovative communities, using truly `trustless` & fair governance systems, we can continue a movement that has been developing since the dawn of humankind. Our diverse world deserves communication and coordination mechanisms that allow us to not only coexist, but achieve balance and thrive together at local, global, and online scales.

We can start our OP Governance journey by joining the Token House. Today’s (optional) quest is to purchase any amount of voting tokens, and assign them to the delegate who best represents your vision for Optimism.

While the Citizens’ House develops its onboarding procedures, you can begin your Citizen journey by getting involved in the [OP community](https://gov.optimism.io/) forum — offering your unique contribution to the OP vision!
