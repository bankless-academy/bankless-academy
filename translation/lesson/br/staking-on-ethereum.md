# Staking on Ethereum

Welcome, Explorer, to your next lesson!

Today we will be investigating the process of “staking”, an action you can take today to build digital wealth by volunteering your computer to help secure Ethereum.

`Staking` serves the same purpose as mining does on the Bitcoin network: it’s a mechanic for processing transactions on the blockchain, in exchange for rewards. But there’s a crucial difference: On Ethereum, you don’t need a powerful computer to compete against others. Instead you lock up `Ether`, Ethereum’s native asset, on the network. In exchange, your computer is granted entry to process transactions and earn rewards.

# Ethereum Wants You!

You can think of `staking` like an “internet bond”.

Much like supporting your government through bonds grants return on investment, supporting Ethereum yields staking rewards. More importantly, like government bonds, staking is a way to show financial support for the values you stand for — and the world you want to live in.

By participating in the staking process and facilitating transactions, your computer becomes a network `validator node`. Now part of the network itself, your node provides more decentralization and security for everyone using Ethereum. As a `staker`, you become a **guardian of Ethereum**, and get rewarded in `Ether`.

It’s time to dive deeper into staking mechanics and uncover the simple, low cost opportunity to start your staking journey today.

Grab your gear, let’s go.

# Blockchain Security

`Stakers` are the line between a secure and legitimate economy on Ethereum, and one filled with `fraud`.

As a leading blockchain, Ethereum has become a global digital economy where digital assets are traded every day. In a functional economy, it is vital that every transaction is legitimate and no participant has power over others. This fairness is known as `credible neutrality` — and without it an economy spins into fraud, distrust, and eventually collapse. In the blockchain world, fraud would look like a user manipulating balances or creating non-existent crypto.

For a transaction to be considered valid, it must be approved by a majority of `validator nodes`. This decentralized agreement is reached using specialised systems called `consensus mechanisms`.

The mechanism changes depending on the blockchain, but the goal is always the same: **generate decentralized agreement, across the network, on the state of the blockchain.**

# Knowledge Check 1

How does staking prevent fraud on Ethereum?

- [ ] By granting power over others.

  > …

- [ ] By creating non-existent crypto.

  > …

- [ ] By generating decentralized agreement.

  > …

# Proof-of-Stake

On Ethereum, `validator nodes` use a `consensus mechanism` called “Proof-of-Stake” to agree on the legitimacy of blockchain transactions. This is where “staking” comes from.

Users take a financial position in the network by staking `Ether`, gaining permission to validate its transactions. When a group of transactions are submitted to the network, a node is randomly selected to verify them — with its results double-checked by the others to ensure honesty.

If your node successfully processes the transactions, your `stake` grows. If your node is too slow or tries to approve fraud, your stake is `slashed` — a penalty charge is applied. In this way, your staked Ether is a form of insurance. Everyone is incentivized to act honestly and keep Ethereum running.

To successfully approve fraud on Ethereum, an attacker would need to gain control of the majority of staked Ether, and therefore a majority of consensus power. That’s why having everyday users involved in staking is so important — it fragments decision making power.

# Knowledge Check 2

True or False: Validator nodes caught processing fraudulent transactions will receive penalties.

- [ ] True

  > …

- [ ] False

  > …

# Validating Transactions

Let’s look at the step-by-step process of how nodes come to agreement using `Proof-of-Stake` consensus:

1. **Staking:** A staker runs a node on their computer, locking their ETH on the network.
2. **Block Building:** Users submit transactions, which are bundled into `blocks`.
3. **Node Assignment:** The network algorithm selects a node to process a block of transactions.
4. **Block Validation:** The chosen `validator node` reviews the block, ensuring its transactions line up with the blockchain `ledger`.
5. **Cross-Verification:** Other nodes double-check and confirm the block’s validity.
6. **Blockchain Addition:** A valid block is added to the Ethereum blockchain.
7. **Rewards:** The staker earns transaction fees and additional Ether rewards.

# Ethernomics

It’s important to understand where the yield for staked `Ether` comes from, and how it fluctuates based on various ecosystem factors. Simply put, rewards are a portion of transaction fees, plus a small amount of newly issued Ether.

The resulting yield can look like anything from a 3% to 16% return on staked Ether per year. The exact amount is based on two key factors:

- 📈 **Network Activity:** In times of low traffic, the reward is lower, and in high traffic, they’re higher.
- 👥 **Amount of Stakers:** With more participants, rewards are further divided.

Yields also change depending on how exactly you stake your Ether. We’ll review our options shortly!

# Types of Staking

We’re not going to sugar-coat it: Running a `validator node` on Ethereum currently requires staking 32 ETH.

That’s a lot of money.

Fortunately, there are easier ways to become a staker and protect Ethereum. The three key methods are:

- 📡 **Solo Staking:** Running your own validator node.
- ⛲ **Staking Pools:** Joining a group of stakers, running a node together.
- 🏦 **Centralized Exchange Staking:** Joining a “crypto bank” node.

Each method requires a different amount of Ether, and technical knowledge to set things up. Generally speaking, the more difficult it is, the more rewards you earn. These methods also have varied impacts on network decentralization — an important point we’ll touch on shortly.

# Types of Staking (Pt. 2)

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-0adb0dc4.png)

**Solo Staking**

🟡 Requires 32 ETH

🟡 Technical Setup

🟢 Decentralizes Ethereum

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-fa455820.png)

**Staking Pools**

🟢 Any amount of ETH

🟢 Easy Setup

🟡 Decentralized Options

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-63e5ec68.png)

**Centralized Exchange Staking**

🟢 Any amount of ETH

🟢 Easy Setup

🔴 Centralizes Ethereum

# Network Centralization

Some staking decentralizes Ethereum, some staking actively centralizes it. What’s that about?

The more validator nodes that are owned by a single entity — a centralized exchange for example — the more power they have to sway `consensus`. If this entity was to gain enough power, they could overpower the network into approving fraudulent transactions, or even denying valid ones. This would destroy Ethereum’s core property of `credible neutrality`.

As guardians of Ethereum, we should be looking for the most decentralized staking option available to us. With the barriers of `solo staking` too high for most of us, today we will be investigating the beginner’s option to decentralized staking, `staking pools`.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/network-centralization-4ef76ee7.png)

# Knowledge Check 4

What would happen if a single entity controlled a majority of staked Ether?

- [ ] They could approve or deny any transaction.

  > …

- [ ] They would control all validator nodes.

  > …

- [ ] Ethereum would stop processing transactions.

  > …

- [ ] All of the above.

  > …

# Staking Pools

The best part about `staking pools` is that it’s entirely handled by `smart contracts`. You don’t have to have met the other stakers in person. You don’t even have to trust anyone that you’re running the node with!

Staking pools are coordinated by `staking providers` like Rocket Pool, connecting stakers across the world! In a pool, a `node operator` stakes a portion of Ether and runs the node, everyone else supplies the remaining Ether. For their service, the node operator earns additional yield.

For the participating stakers, their membership to the pool is represented by “Liquid Staking Tokens” (LSTs). These `tokens` are like a share of a pool’s staked ether; The holder earns a portion of rewards equal to their stake, and can trade or redeem them for their stake at any time.

So by simply holding Rocket Pool’s staked Ether token, rETH, you’re earning staking rewards and helping to decentralize Ethereum.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/staking-pools-13994270.png)

# Liquid Staking Tokens

The best thing about `LSTs` is that even when Ether staked and gathering yield, it’s kept `liquid`.

In this case, “liquid” means that it can still flow throughout the ecosystem; It’s like being able to use your share of the staking pool… as money! LSTs can be swapped, used as collateral for loans, or even deposited on `restaking` platforms for bonus yield.

When we look at eStaked Ether is an unprecedented form of money.

# Knowledge Check 5

Which entity hosts the staking pool?

- [ ] The Node Operator

  > …

- [ ] The Additional Stakers

  > …

- [ ] The Staking Provider

  > Correct! The pool is hosted via the provider’s smart contracts.

# Network Centralization — Again!

Now, staking pools themselves have the same catch as the different staking methods: **there are varied degrees of centralization and decentralization.**

While Rocket Pool has taken the steps necessary to allow anyone, anywhere to become a `node operator`, staking providers like Lido, Bedrock, and Stakewise  use a small range of private hosting businesses to run their nodes — centralizing staked Ether!

If any of these platforms gain control over 33% of all staked Ether, they could begin causing problems on the network at their decision. If they reach 50%, they could begin threatening Ethereum’s `credible neutrality`.

Today, Lido’s share hovers around the 33% mark.

Guarding Ethereum begins with choosing a decentralized staking provider.

# Knowledge Check 6

True or False: Supporting new node operators helps to decentralize Ethereum.

- [ ] True

  > …

- [ ] False

  > …

# rETH - Your Path to Decentralized Staking

For today’s quest, we are going to become stakers with Rocket Pool, taking shared ownership over a staking pool. Alongside your fellow Explorers, you will be contributing to the decentralization of Ethereum.

As your Ether holdings grow, you will unlock greater opportunities to decentralize Ethereum and earn rewards. By taking any of these options today, you will complete your quest:

- 🪙 \*\*≥\*\*0.001 ETH: Buy rETH on a `decentralized exchange`.
- 💰 \*\*≥\*\*0.1 ETH: `Mint` new rETH and help run a pool.
- ⛲ \*\*≥\*\*8-16 ETH: Run your own pool as a `node operator`.

Note: rETH is worth slightly more than regular ETH. This is because staking rewards are directly added to the value of the rETH token. By simply holding, your rETH will grow in value against ETH as staking rewards are added to its value.

It’s time to become a guardian of Ethereum. Good luck on your quest, Explorer. May your commitment to Ethereum’s decentralized future be greatly rewarded!
