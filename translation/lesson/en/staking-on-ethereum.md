# Staking on Ethereum

Welcome, Explorer, to your next lesson!

Today, we’ll look at the process of “staking” — a simple way to build digital wealth.

`Staking` works just like `mining` does on the Bitcoin network: as a system that processes transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards. It is how we keep the network `decentralized`.

However, there’s an important difference between mining and staking. If you stake on Ethereum, you don’t need a powerful computer to compete against others. Simply locking Ether (ETH) in a network `smart contract` helps keep Ethereum running and rewards you.

# Ethereum Wants You!

Think of `staking` like an “internet bond”.

Just like supporting your government through bonds can give you payoffs, supporting `validator nodes` brings rewards! Even better, staking is a way to show financial support for your values and the world you want to live in. Much like government bonds.

As you stake Ether, it is assigned to a validator node working to process transactions on Ethereum. The more Ether staked, the more nodes Ethereum can have… thus the more `decentralized` and secure it becomes. 

As a `staker`, you become a **guardian of Ethereum!**

Now, let's take a deeper look into staking mechanics and discover the simple, low-cost opportunity to start your staking journey today.

Grab your gear, let’s go.

# Blockchain Security

`Validator nodes` are the lines between a secure and legitimate economy on Ethereum, and are filled with `fraud`.

Ethereum as a leading blockchain economy works to ensure that every transaction is valid and no participant is better than others. This fairness, known as `credible neutrality`, is vital. Why? Nobody wants to be a part of an economy where there's fraud and dustrust — it'll eventually collapse. In Blockchain, fraud looks like a user manipulating balances or creating non-existent crypto.

A transaction can only be legitimate when it is approved by a majority of validator nodes. Nodes reach decentralized agreement using a specialised system called a `consensus mechanism`.

This mechanism can change depending on the blockchain, but there's one goal: **to** **generate** **a decentralized agreement across the network, and on the state of the blockchain.**

# Knowledge Check 1

How does staking prevent fraud on Ethereum?

- [ ] By giving validator nodes power over others.

	> …

- [ ] By creating non-existent crypto for certain people.

	> …

- [ ] By generating decentralized agreement.

	> …

# Proof-of-Stake

On Ethereum, `validator nodes` use a `consensus mechanism` called “Proof-of-Stake” to validate blockchain transactions.

Users who want to run a validator node on their computer must gather and lock 32 ETH. Now, that’s a lot of money. In exchange for taking a large financial “stake” in the network, the node operator is allowed to propose and review blocks of transactions on Ethereum — and earn rewards. 

When a group of transactions are submitted to the network, they are grouped into blocks. A validator node is randomly selected to propose the next block and its decision is double-checked by other nodes to ensure honesty. When a node successfully proposes a block, its `stake` grows. 

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/proof-of-stake-d4b0117c.svg)

# Slashing

When it’s too slow or tries to approve fraud, its stake gets `slashed`, and it gets a penalty charge. This way, staked Ether becomes a form of insurance; nodes are incentivized to be honest and keep Ethereum running.

For an attacker to approve fraud on Ethereum, they would need to control majority of the validator nodes, and therefore a majority of staked Ether. That’s why its important to have everyday users involved in staking — the `decentralized` ownership divides the power to make decisions.

# Knowledge Check 2

True or False: Validator nodes caught processing fraudulent blocks will receive penalty charges.

- [ ] True

	> …

- [ ] False

	> …

# Validating Transactions

Here's the step-by-step process of how nodes come to agreement using `Proof-of-Stake` consensus:

1. **Staking:** A `node operator` locks 32 ETH on the network and begins running a `validator node`.
2. **Block Building:** Users submit transactions ordered into `blocks` by `block builders`.
3. **Proposer Selection****:** An algorithm selects a validator node to propose the next block to be added to the blockchain.
4. **Block Proposal:** This `block proposer` selects and reviews the potential block, granting their `attestation` if valid.
5. **Cross-Verification:** Other nodes double-check the block, also granting attestation if valid. Invalid blocks are discarded and the proposer is `slashed`.
6. **Block Addition:** The valid block is added to the Ethereum blockchain.
7. **Reward:** The block proposer gets part of the block’s transaction fees and additional rewards.

# Knowledge Check 3

What is the name of the validator node selecting the next block to be added to Ethereum?

- [ ] Staker

	> …

- [ ] Block Builder

	> …

- [ ] Block Proposer

	> …

# Ethernomics

For providing Ether to a validator node, stakers earn a portion of its rewards.

Rewards received by validator nodes is based on various ecosystem factors and can change. Simply put, the rewards are a portion of transaction fees and a small amount of newly issued Ether added to new blocks.

Annual yield can look like anything from a 3% to 16% return on staked Ether. The exact amount is based on two key factors:

- 📈 **Network Activity:** If traffic is low, rewards are lower. In high traffic, they’re higher.
- 👥 **Number of Validator Nodes:** Rewards get further divided with more participants.

Yields also change depending on how exactly you stake your Ether. Let’s look at our options.

# Types of Staking

Running a `validator node` currently requires locking 32 ETH, but new staking methods have made guarding Ethereum available to everyone.

There are now several ways to guard Ethereum:

- 📡 **Solo Staking:** Run a validator node yourself.
- ⛲ **Staking Pools:** Join a group of stakers and run a node together.
- 🏦 **Centralized Exchange Staking:** Join a “crypto bank” node.

Each method is needs a different amount of technical knowledge to get set up, and its own associated risks.

If you’re comfortable holding your `private keys`, but don’t have 32 ETH, then consider joining others in a staking pool.

But if you’re not yet okay with taking `self-custody` of your crypto, check out Centralized Exchange staking (our [Wallet Basics](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics) lesson will guide you!).

The methods may also have a positive or negative impact on network decentralization, **so if you want to become a guardian of Ethereum, you’ll want to help decentralize the network!**

# Types of Staking (Pt. 2)

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-9de268fd.svg)

**Solo Staking**

🟡 Requires 32 ETH

🟡 Technical Setup

🟢 Decentralizes Ethereum

**Risks:** You may lose your private keys or get slashed when your node is offline.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-96f11caf.svg)

**Staking Pools**

🟢 Any amount of ETH

🟢 Easy Setup

🟡 Decentralized Options

**Risks:** There could be a bug in the staking pool’s smart contract or you may lose your private keys.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-27091ef5.svg)

**Centralized Exchange Staking**

🟢 Any amount of ETH

🟢 Easy Setup

🔴 Centralizes Ethereum

**Risks:** Your exchange could declare bankruptcy — this may lead to loss of your holdings.

# Network Centralization

Imagine Ethereum as a web of connected `validator nodes`.

When nodes are controlled by one or a few entities, the entire web is imbalanced and insecure. To avoid this and build a resilient web, we need lots of unique connection points.

A single entity gaining control over enough staked Ether and typically, enough nodes, would force blocks of transactions through the `centralized` section of the web. This entity could begin approving fraudulent blocks, or even denying valid ones — destroying Ethereum’s `credible neutrality`.

As guardians of Ethereum, we must focus on staking methods that keep the web in balance, and `decentralized`. With the barriers of running your own validator node so high, let’s investigate the beginner’s option to decentralized staking: `staking pools`.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/network-centralization-0622ba07.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

What would happen if a single entity controlled a majority of staked Ether?

- [ ] They could approve fraudulent transactions.

	> …

- [ ] They’d gain control of all validator nodes.

	> …

- [ ] Ethereum would stop processing transactions altogether.

	> …

- [ ] All of the above.

	> …

# Staking Pools

The best part about `staking pools` is that they’re entirely run by `smart contracts`. You don’t have to meet the other stakers in person — and you don’t have to trust them (but you do have to trust the smart contract).

Staking pools are coordinated by `staking providers`, digital platforms connecting stakers across the world! In staking pools, a `node operator` stakes at least 16 ETH, runs the node, and the other participants supply the remaining Ether. 

For their service, the node operator earns additional yield. For the remaining staking participants, their membership to the pool is represented by “Liquid Staking Tokens” (LSTs). These `tokens` represent a share of a pool’s staked Ether; The holder earns a portion of rewards proportional to their stake, and can redeem them for their stake at any time.

So by simply holding an LST, like Rocket Pool’s rETH, you own a share of a staking pool. Your Ether is helping to decentralize Ethereum, and earning staking rewards!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/staking-pools-46c96251.svg)

# Knowledge Check 5

Which entity hosts the staking pool?

- [ ] The node operator.

	> …

- [ ] The remaining staking participants.

	> …

- [ ] The staking provider.

	> Correct! The pool is hosted via the provider’s smart contracts.

# Liquid Staking Tokens

The best thing about `LSTs` is that even while your Ether is staked and gathering yield, you control it in `liquid` form.

In this case, “liquid” means that it can still flow throughout the ecosystem; It’s like being able to use your share of the staking pool… as money! LSTs can be swapped, used as collateral for loans, or even deposited on `restaking` platforms for bonus yield.

This is also great because it further opens access to staked Ether: Often a staking pool has a minimum deposit for adding Ether the pool, somewhere around 0.01 ETH. With LSTs, you can buy even smaller increments of staked Ether on your favourite `decentralized exchange`.

Through cases like this, staked Ether starts to seem like an unprecedented form of money — one that protects the ecosystem, while producing yield.

# Network Centralization — Again!

Now, staking pools and LSTs have the same catch as the different staking methods: **they have varied degrees of centralization and decentralization.**

Staking providers like Rocket Pool have taken the steps necessary to allow anyone, anywhere to become the `node operator` of a staking pool. This supports new node operators in building their 32 ETH stake, and helps to decentralize Ethereum. However, many staking providers only allow a small range of their contacts to run their nodes, presenting high risk for centralized staked Ether.

If any entity gained control over 33% of all staked Ether, they could begin causing problems on the network. At 50%, they could begin threatening Ethereum’s `credible neutrality`. 

As of early 2024, staking provider Lido has a share hovering around the 33% mark.

Guarding Ethereum begins with choosing a decentralized staking provider.

# Knowledge Check 6

True or False: Supporting new node operators helps to decentralize Ethereum.

- [ ] True

	> …

- [ ] False

	> …

# rETH - Your Path to Decentralized Staking

It’s time to become a staker — a guardian of Ethereum.

For today’s quest, we will be dipping our toes into a `staking pool`, over at Rocket Pool. It’s quite simple: mint or buy Rocket Pool’s `liquid staking token`: **rETH**. As the first step on your staking journey, you’ll be funding a `validator node` so it can process transactions. You’ll begin decentralizing Ethereum and earning rewards!

**Note:** One thing we haven’t mentioned yet is how staking rewards are distributed. It depends on the staking method. On Rocket Pool, rewards are added directly to the value of the rETH token (which is why it’s worth a bit more). As you earn rewards, the value of rETH will continue to rise against regular `ETH`.

Good luck on your quest, Explorer. May your commitment to Ethereum’s decentralized future be greatly rewarded!
