# Wallet Intro

**Greetings!**

Welcome to Bankless Academy. We’re excited to guide you on your journey into `Web3`. To get started, you will need some essential equipment: a digital wallet.

A digital wallet is your passport to exploring the various worlds of Web3. This tool grants you access to incredible new possibilities while safeguarding your assets and identity.

In this lesson, we’ll introduce you to digital wallets, how they work, and how to set yours up to safely embark on your Web3 journey.

Let’s get started!

# Wallet Definition

In the world of cryptocurrency, a wallet refers to an application or device you can use to interact with a `blockchain`.

Your `wallet` functions as a lock-box that secures your access to the blockchain.

When your wallet is connected to a blockchain, you can make purchases, transfer digital assets, interact with applications, and more!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/wallet-definition-e8f8f9a8.svg)

# Knowledge Check 1

What is a wallet?

- [ ] A blockchain
- [ ] A cryptocurrency
- [ ] A digital collectible
- [ ] An app/device used to interact with a blockchain

# Recovery Phrase

When you set up a new `wallet`, the software generates a unique `recovery phrase` that is specific to that wallet account.

Also sometimes called a _seed phrase_ or _secret recovery phrase_, your recovery phrase can be used to access your wallet and crypto assets if:

- Your wallet app or hardware fails unexpectedly or gets damaged.
- You are unable to access it due to misplacement or theft.
- You want to access your wallet account through the wallet app on a different computer or device.

Most recovery phrases are a list of 12 to 24 words that represent a unique piece of data. That data is used to generate the `public key` and `private key` for your wallet.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/recovery-phrase-c2d8fa26.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

What can you do with your recovery phrase?

- [ ] [A] Recover your wallet if lost, stolen, or damaged
- [ ] [B] Access your wallet on multiple devices
- [ ] [C] Both A & B
- [ ] [D] None of the above

# Public Key

You just learned how your `recovery phrase` relates to a `public key` and `private key`.

Note that a wallet can contain multiple accounts, and _each account_ has a unique pair of public and private keys.

Think of a public key like your home address. It is public, anyone can see it, and it identifies the location to use to send crypto assets to you.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/public-key-b6387071.svg)

# Private Key

If your `public key` is like your home address, then your `private key` is like your house key.

It's called private because _only you_ should have access to it.

The private key unlocks access to your wallet and your crypto assets, allowing you to send them to other wallet addresses.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/private-key-ca271641.svg)

# Knowledge Check 3

Your public key is like your _____ and your private key is like your _____

- [ ] Routing Number / Account Number
- [ ] Home address / House key
- [ ] Address / Zip code
- [ ] Phone Number / Social Security Number

# Custodial Wallet

Since your `private key` unlocks access to your `wallet`, keeping it private and secure is very important!

Not all wallets let you control your private key. With a `custodial wallet`, another party controls it. Accounts on Coinbase and Kraken are examples of custodial wallets that hold your private key.

This may be all some people need, but it requires you to trust these third parties to secure your crypto assets and give you access when you want to trade them or send them somewhere. Plus, your access to the world of `DeFi` applications will be limited. 

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/custodial-wallet-29ed2b65.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

Do you control your private key with a custodial wallet?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

# Non-custodial Wallet

Your passport to the exciting worlds of `DeFi`  and `Web3`—and the best way to safeguard your `private key` is a `non-custodial wallet`. 

Remember: if you lose your private key, you will not be able to access your wallet to spend, withdraw, or transfer your crypto assets.

Fortunately, you _can_ still recover your wallet with your `recovery phrase`. But if you lose that too, you will lose access to your wallet FOREVER!!!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/non-custodial-wallet-aee2708b.svg)

# Knowledge Check 5

Are you responsible for your private key with a non-custodial wallet?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

# Wallet Security

## ALWAYS do this to protect your recovery phrase:

✅ write it down

✅ use a durable material (i.e laminated paper, engraved metal)

✅ store it in a safe place

## NEVER do this to protect your recovery phrase:

🛑 save your recovery in an online drive

🛑 screenshot your private key

🛑 reveal your recovery key to anyone

# Knowledge Check 6

What is the safest way to protect your recovery phrase?

- [ ] Save it on your computer and print it out.
- [ ] Take a screenshot and save it on your phone.
- [ ] Save it in your Dropbox account.
- [ ] Write it on a durable material and store it in a safe place.

# Hot Wallet

There are two major types of `non-custodial wallets`: software wallets (also called `hot wallets`) and hardware wallets (also called `cold wallets`)

A software wallet is an app or browser extension that remains connected to the internet.

- PROS 👍: It is usually free, simple to set up, and easy to use.
- CONS 👎: Because it is software connected to the internet, it's potentially a target for hackers.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/hot-wallet-1d444d7c.svg)

# Cold Wallet

A `cold wallet`, or hardware wallet, is only connected to the internet when you physically connect it to a computer or device.

- PROS 👍: It is more secure from threats like hacking.
- CONS 👎: It is not free, not ideal for quick transactions, and can be cumbersome to use.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/cold-wallet-59646edb.svg)

# Knowledge Check 7

Is a cold wallet more secure than a hot wallet?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

# MetaMask Wallet

There are several `non-custodial` `hot wallets` available today. We will explore the popular MetaMask Wallet for the remainder of this lesson since:

- It is likely to be compatible with most `DeFi` apps.
- It has a browser extension for Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Firefox internet browsers.
- It is also available as a mobile app for Android and iOS users.

# Knowledge Check 8

Is MetaMask a custodial wallet?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
