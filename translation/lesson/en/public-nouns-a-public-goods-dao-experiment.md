# Introduction

**Welcome, Explorers, to a new Community Lesson!**

In web3, everything starts with **community**. Thanks to blockchain technology and Ethereum, communities can now do more than just coordinate! They can take **action**, **govern** shared resources, **fund** aligned projects, and **support** the future they want to see 🌱

In this lesson, you’ll explore how **public goods, DAOs, NFTs**, and **onchain governance** come together in a bold experiment called **Public Nouns**. Think of open-source tools, Ethereum infrastructure, or free educational platforms like Bankless Academy. These are digital public goods. They can benefit everyone, but since they are not profit-driven, they’re generally hard to fund.

To tackle the challenge, Public Nouns raised a question: _**What if a decentralized community could fund these goods directly using art, culture, and code?**_ **👨🏻‍💻**

Let’s find out what happens when people care enough to build!  ⚒️

# Public goods are good

To start, let’s learn what public goods are 💡

Public goods are resources that **everyone can access, and one person’s use doesn’t reduce its availability to others.**

In more economic terms, they are **non-excludable and non-rivalrous.**

It might be a difficult concept to grasp at first, but think of clean air, streetlights, and public spaces like libraries and parks 🌳

In web3, public goods include things like **open-source code** (such as Ethereum clients), **shared infrastructure**, and **free educational resources** like tutorials and documentation. These are the digital commons that can be used by everyone, and their availability isn’t reduced if used 🌐

Public Nouns is a web3-native experiment designed to support both **web3 and real-world** public goods without middlemen, using **art, community, and culture** 🎨

# Knowledge Check 1

What’s true about public goods?

- [ ] They run out when used
- [ ] They’re invite-only spaces
- [ ] They are free and shared
- [ ] They’re locked behind a paywall

# Using web3 to fund public goods

To understand how web3 enables funding for public goods, we need to define its **core building blocks  🧱**

If you’re already familiar with them, you’ll be able to engage with the next slides more confidently. If not, do not worry, we encourage you to _read carefully_, as these are **foundational** ideas that will help everything else make sense.

We’ll cover:

- **NFTs:** non-fungible tokens used for identity and coordination 🖼️
- **DAOs:** decentralized autonomous organizations with shared treasuries 🌐
- **Onchain governance:** transparent, code-based systems for collective decisions 🗳️

These elements come together in a _unique case study_: **Public Nouns**, a community experiment for public goods funding.

# What is an NFT? The role of meme culture

Ethereum has different types of tokens. **NFT stands for** _**non-fungible**_ aka known as **ERC-1155**. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, it refers to a set of **technical standards** that govern how tokens are created and function on Ethereum. 

Unlike interchangeable tokens, like ETH or USDC (ERC-20s), each ERC-1155 is distinct and can represent many things: art, music, identity, status, or access. 

In Public Nouns, they’re **symbols of shared values.** Each one features an artwork representing a **public goods project**. These visuals act as shared symbols within each community and the Ethereum ecosystem. Examples include **MolochDAO, Gitcoin, Treegens**, and more. As communities emerge and others wind down, Public Nouners can propose new art/communities to be included 🗳️

The art draws from **meme culture**, as a way to define **cultural identity** and help people **coordinate** around a shared mission 🎯

# Knowledge Check 2

What does a Public Nouns NFT represent?

- [ ] Pets of each community member
- [ ] Speculative art with no intrinsic value
- [ ] A specific public goods project
- [ ] Memecoins

# What is a DAO?

A **DAO**, or **Decentralized Autonomous Organization**, is a web3-native structure for making collective decisions. It manages a shared treasury and its community members vote on new initiatives and how to fund them, openly and without middlemen ⛓️

DAOs were born on **Ethereum. Smart contracts**, self-executing programs deployed on the blockchain, have made it possible to automate coordination through code. These programs define the rules: **who** can propose a project, **how** votes are counted, and **when** funds are released 🔓

**Public Nouns is a DAO**. If you hold in your Ethereum wallet a Public Noun NFT, you’re part of the DAO. You can **propose** new projects, **vote** on proposals, and **help decide** which public goods get supported 🗳️

There are many kinds of DAOs. Some manage protocols, others invest capital, and some, like Public Nouns, exist to support public goods. Its mission is to create impact, not profit.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/public-nouns-a-public-goods-dao-experiment/what-is-a-dao-e9562a03.png)

# Nouns and Public Nouns

Now that you know what a DAO is, let’s look at the one that inspired it all: **Nouns** ⌐◨-◨

Nouns began as an experiment in **community-owned culture**. Every 24 hours, a pixel-art “Noun” is generated and auctioned onchain. The ETH goes into a shared treasury, and each Noun gives its holder one vote in the DAO.

The Nouns movement started with a meme and lets the community **decide what to build**. Projects can go from media to tooling to global events. Its most iconic trait? **The Noggles** ⌐◨-◨, pixelated glasses worn by every Noun.

This cultural icon has expanded from the _digital realm to real-world landmarks_ and events such as the [Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo](https://x.com/punk4156/status/1822040547059446040), to a projection on the [Eiffel Tower](https://x.com/johnhamon_/status/1761348271421747554), and has even been part of a [Super Bowl commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbke3F1VnsQ). Noggles are a **cultural symbol of shared Nouns identity** across sub-DAOs like Lil Nouns, Gnars, and of course, Public Nouns.

# Knowledge Check 3

What connects Public Nouns to Nouns?

- [ ] They have shared treasury and governance
- [ ] Coded fork and shared symbols
- [ ] Founded by the same web3 team
- [ ] They use pixel art that changes every week

# Forking & Governance Contracts

Public Nouns is a **fork of Nouns.** In web3, _forking_ means copying **open-source code** and adapting it for a new mission. Public Nouns **kept the daily auction model**, but instead of having random characters with different traits, each NFT features symbolic artwork tied to a public good.

The system relies on three core contracts, each with a specific role:

- **Auction**: handles timing and sales of NFTs 🖼️
- **Treasury**: holds the ETH and releases it when proposals pass 🗝️
- **Governor**: developed by Compound, it manages proposals, voting rules, and quorum 🗳️

These **smart contracts work together** to define how proposals are made, approved and executed, all automatically and onchain ⚡

This kind of **modular approach** is one of Web3’s biggest strengths: shared infrastructure becomes a public good of its own, ready to be _remixed, repurposed, and reimagined_ 💭

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/public-nouns-a-public-goods-dao-experiment/forking-governance-contracts-4909e454.png)

# How Onchain Funding Works

To understand onchain funding, here’s a brief summary of how it works:

**🎨 Step 1**: the **auction contract** creates a new Public Noun every 12 hours (or when the past auction is settled), and sends the ETH from each auction directly to the treasury.

**🗳️ Step 2**: the **governor contract** manages proposals and voting made by DAO members - only when a proposal passes, meeting quorum and approval thresholds, can it be executed.

**💰 Step 3:** the **treasury contract** holds the funds and is only triggered by the governor contract, often with a built-in time delay.

This setup means funds **move only when the community approves.** No shortcuts, no central admin, no backroom decisions.

In simple terms, it’s a protocol for funding: transparent, automatic, and verifiable by anyone on the Ethereum blockchain. Check out the full contract [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2bbebfeca0febde8c70ef8501c991f3ab2095862#code) on Etherscan.

# Knowledge Check 4

What does forking mean?

- [ ] Attending the annual Public Nouns dinner
- [ ] Rewritten the governance contract
- [ ] Copying code and reusing it
- [ ] Delegate the ability to vote on proposals

# Public Nouns’ Impact - Part I

Since inception, Public Nouns has funded more than 50 projects through community-approved proposals. These **early-stage experiments,** which can be web3 or non-web3 related, were designed by community members with new and disruptive ideas 💡

**Web3 Public Goods**

- [Protocol Guild](https://x.com/ProtocolGuild): long-term funding for Ethereum core contributors ⛓️
- [PizzaDAO](https://x.com/Pizza_DAO): in-person events promoting web3 values through pizza 🍕
- [Giveth](https://x.com/Giveth): empowers changemakers to accept crypto donations 💜
- [Gardens Conviction Voting](https://publicnouns.wtf/vote/50): bottom-up web3 governance framework 🌱

This very lesson, content and onchain certification, is also possible thanks to the support of the community. Check out the full list of projects and proposals supported [here](https://publicnouns.wtf/vote). Public Nouns shows the **impact a small internet-native community can have** when it funds public goods with intent, speed, and shared values.

# Public Nouns’ Impact - Part II

Public Nouns doesn’t just support web3 public goods, its mission extends into real-world public goods too. The community has backed projects focused on climate action, education, local food systems, and regeneration 🌍

Recent examples include:

- [Kokonut Network](https://publicnouns.wtf/vote/69): syntropic agroforestry farms using web3 🌱
- [Solar Foundation:](https://publicnouns.wtf/vote/71) expanding access to solar power in Tanzania
- [Tree Planting Guinness World Record Sponsorship](https://publicnouns.wtf/vote/38) in Thailand
- [Ayowecca Uganda:](https://publicnouns.wtf/vote/63) transforming lifestyle of indigenous and marginalized communities

Each project followed a _three-step process_:

1. The proposal was **posted** in the [Public Nouns Discord ](/20f12837a13b80fca3f0c312ba7d1fac)🗨️
2. A 7-day (suggested) community **discussion** period took place 🧠
3. The proposal advanced to **onchain voting** at [publicnouns.wtf ](http://publicnouns.wtf/)🗳️

# Mission accomplished

Public Nouns set out with a **clear mission**: fund experiments in public goods using **onchain tools, community decision-making, and symbolic NFTs.** From protocol development and public education to coordination infrastructure and community-led initiatives, its impact is widely felt within the **Ethereum ecosystem.**

**How long will this experiment last?** _That’s still being defined._ As more OG members move on, and new members join, the community is now exploring how the mission can evolve ✨

One of the core strengths of web3 is **building in public**. This supports innovation and cross-collaboration that can shape the next phase of Public Nouns. Whatever the future might hold, it is clear that Public Nouns has helped pioneer the frontier of **mission-driven, onchain funding** - with an impact that will echo for years to come ⏳

Whether through Public Nouns itself or new forks, the model remains **open, tested, and available**. The tools are onchain. The lessons are public. And the invitation to keep building, is always open ⚒️
