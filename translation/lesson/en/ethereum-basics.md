# Ethereum Basics

Welcome, Explorer, to one of the most important lessons at Bankless Academy.

Today we’re looking at Ethereum: the next era of the internet. It’s a revolutionary platform powering a world of new internet `apps` and digital currencies.

A simple way to think of Ethereum is like the Google or Apple `app store`, but with some key differences:

- 💸 It uses `cryptocurrency` instead of `fiat currency` (the US dollar, the euro, or the Chinese yuan).
- 📡 It’s a layer added directly to your internet browser, unlocking new functionality on websites.
- ⚖️ The store rules are agreed on by users and app builders. There’s no central corporation in charge.

To understand why millions of people are using Ethereum across the world, we need to look at its core mission…

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/ethereum-basics-b2e09ce5.png)

# A Global Town Square

Over the last forty years, the internet has become the world’s town square.

Here, total strangers connect, exchange ideas, goods and services, and even ignite global movements together. It's humanity's most powerful intersection of connection, creativity, and innovation.

**But it has one big problem…**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/a-global-town-square-fcb47024.svg)

# Centralized Services

**The internet relies on a small group of corporations that don’t always have our best interests at heart.**

`Centralized services` have more control over the internet than ever before, acting as `intermediaries` for almost everything you do online.

Think of how big banks manage your purchases, Meta monitors your social interactions, and Apple or Google control the apps you can have on your phone. Through their rules, fees, and corporate motives, they have an incredible influence over your digital exchanges.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/centralized-services-adf5be05.svg)

# One-sided Trades

We call them `centralized services` because all the power is in one place. It’s often like being stuck under the rule of a king who knows exactly how to get what he wants from you. You might be surprised at the reality of your trades…

💸 Banks charge you fees and invest your money for their own profit. .

💳 Payment networks, like Visa & Mastercard, sell your purchase data to advertisers.

📞 Social platforms, like Instagram, can view your private conversations.

🪓 Content platforms, like YouTube, can freely delete creators’ entire careers — with no fair trial.

These shady rules and fees are often hidden away in the ‘Terms & Conditions’, and tend to get worse over time. Take a closer look at your favorite service agreements here: [https://tosdr.org/](https://tosdr.org/) 👀

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/one-sided-trades-8d68270f.svg)

# Knowledge Check 1

True or False: Centralized services have unnecessary control over your online activity.

- [ ] True

> Correct!

- [ ] False

> Try again.

# An Open Internet

😤 **Had enough of platforms that don’t respect your needs?**

---

This is the `value-extractive` internet we’ve become used to.

Called “walled gardens” for how restrictive these services are and how difficult they make it to leave, finding better alternatives can be time consuming and expensive. It often feels easier to just put up with the high fees, lack of transparency, and one-sided trades.

We need a fairer, more reliable internet, beyond intermediaries and their walled gardens. We need an online space where power is held by the user — the way the internet was initially built to be.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/an-open-internet-31819e5b.svg)

# Peer-to-Peer Trades

The solution starts with changing how the internet is connected.

In traditional internet services, information or money from one `peer` goes through an `intermediary` checkpoint before arriving at its destination. Theoretically, these intermediaries can do whatever they want before the trade is complete.

**Peer → Intermediary → Peer**

But there’s a second model of computer interaction, called `peer-to-peer` networking. It replaces intermediary services with automated, transparent processes, using computer code.

**Peer → Automation → Peer**

It’s like replacing your intermediary with a self-service kiosk. Here, nobody is above the rules; “Code, not kings.” Services become more predictable, fees go down, and users regain control over their interactions.

As we’ll see, a peer-to-peer internet changes everything.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/peer-to-peer-trades-f043c3c0.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

How can automation improve your online experiences?

- [ ] By increasing the reach of intermediaries.

> Try again.

- [ ] By giving participants more control.

> Correct!

# Ethereum: The Open Internet

⚖️ **Wouldn’t the internet be a better place if the same rules applied to everyone?**

---

Think of Ethereum as a digital city, where everything—from businesses to public services—is run by self-service, transparent systems. There are no intermediaries. With public-facing programming, users can easily review their trade terms and even inspect how the system works.

Transactions in the city are noted on a public record called the `Ethereum blockchain`. The blockchain tracks and stores digital property in the city, removing the need for another classic intermediary — the bank!

Even the city’s governance process is automated. Any changes to a system’s rules are agreed on by users and builders. A small tax on each transaction goes towards maintaining the city.

On Ethereum, democratic code has replaced kings. Nobody is above the rules.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/ethereum-the-open-internet-ab794154.svg)

# The Decentralized Economy

To access Ethereum you’ll use your computer or mobile device’s web browser. With just one account you can log into the entirety of this new internet — a single login called a `crypto wallet`. This universal account makes it easier to change services and escape “walled gardens”.

When you enable the Ethereum app layer, you can access new websites known as `dApps`. These are the self-service systems we mentioned earlier. dApps offer digital goods and services like:

- 🤝 sending or trading currencies, stocks and other digital goods, but with **low fees and 24/7 service**.
- 📻 connection with your favorite creators, but you can **unlock unique perks and opportunities** while ensuring your money goes directly to the artist.
- 👪 social media, but if you dislike the platform you can **easily transfer your social circle** to a new one.
- 🗳️ donating to your favorite projects, but even a $1 donation receives **a large matching bonus, meaning greater impact**.
- ⚙️ renting out your computer’s processing power for **passive income**.

By removing intermediaries, banks, and individual accounts for each service, Ethereum has made its economy `decentralized` (this is the “d” in “dApp”). dApps get better and better as they compete on quality — not unclear business practices and control.

# Using a dApp

Using `dApps` is similar to using regular apps and internet services.

Let’s simulate using a dApp for swapping `crypto` online. In this simulation we’ll swap USDC, an `onchain` US dollar, for `ETH`, Ethereum’s native currency.

1. Connect your `crypto wallet` to the dApp’s website.
2. Confirm that you want to allow this dApp to interact with your Ethereum wallet.
3. Swap all of your USDC to ETH by clicking “Maximum”.
4. Initiate the swap.
5. In your wallet, check the terms of your trade, and then sign.
6. Great! Your swap is being processed on Ethereum and will finalize shortly.

Plugging your wallet into a dApp and swapping cryptocurrencies is that easy. Now you can send it to friends, use it to make purchases, or try other financial service dApps.

# Knowledge Check 3

On Ethereum, services get better and better because…

- [ ] Business practices are more transparent.

> Try again.

- [ ] You can easily change service providers.

> Try again.

- [ ] Both of the above.

> Correct!

# A Global Banking System

⌛ **Do you want a faster, cheaper way to transfer money internationally?**

---

Ethereum makes it possible for you to send and store `crypto` without a intermediaries, with better services at lower costs.

⚡ With crypto, you can send money anywhere in the world for as little as one cent — and it only takes a few seconds! Compare this to sending money through a bank, where they can charge you 3-4% in fees, and take 1-5 days.

🔐 You’re the only person with access to your Ethereum account. There’s no intermediary loaning out your savings or controlling what you do with your money. Funds are stored in your personal `crypto wallet` — the same one you used to connect to a dApp earlier.

On Ethereum, you’re your own bank, and you feel like it!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/a-global-banking-system-5a241dfc.svg)

# Sending a Payment

Let’s use another simulation to practice sending cryptocurrency. Try sending your 0.015 `ETH` to the Bankless Academy `crypto wallet`.

1. Unlock your wallet.
2. Inside of your wallet, select send.
3. Adjust the amount to 0.015 ETH by clicking “Maximum”.
4. Confirm the token and amount.
5. In contacts, select banklessacademy.eth.
6. That’s it! Your international transfer was done in seconds, and no intermediary could stop you.

With Ethereum wallets, you can own and send more than just cryptocurrency. Transferable assets include any digital property that can be stored `onchain`. Digital art, club memberships, show tickets, stocks, website address ownership, and even real-world property rights have made their way onto Ethereum.

# Knowledge Check 4

True or False: On Ethereum, you can be your own bank.

- [ ] True

> Correct. On Ethereum you can go “Bankless”! Lower fees, more control over your money.

- [ ] False

> Try again.

# How it Works

Let’s bring everything together by taking a quick look at how Ethereum makes it all possible.

As a `peer-to-peer` network, Ethereum is made up of tens of thousands of computers spread across the world. These devices, known as `validator nodes`, have been volunteered by their owners to help run the network. Using automated software, a validator will process transactions and verify the results of others to prevent fraud. In doing so, the validator generates `ether` rewards for its owner.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/how-it-works-08c71cad.svg)

# How it Works (Pt. II)

The transaction you submitted earlier was processed by these Ethereum network `validator nodes`.

1. Your ETH transaction was submitted to the Ethereum Network.
2. A validator checked your transaction for errors. Other validators double-checked their results.
3. Your transaction was added to the network’s public ledger, the `Ethereum blockchain`.
4. We received your transferred ETH in our account.

You might be wondering why these validators don’t just run off with your funds. The short answer is because Ethereum makes this virtually impossible. Your upcoming lesson, “Blockchain Basics”, will help you understand more.
