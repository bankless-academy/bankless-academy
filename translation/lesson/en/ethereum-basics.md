# Ethereum Basics

Welcome, Explorer, to one of the most important lessons at Bankless Academy. 

Today we’re looking at Ethereum: the next era of the internet. It’s a community-run platform powering a world of new internet `apps` and `cryptocurrencies`.

A simple way to think of Ethereum is like the Google or Apple `app store`, but with some key differences:

- 💸 It uses a new type of programmable money called cryptocurrency.
- 📡 It plugs into your internet browser, unlocking new apps directly on websites.
- ⚖️ The rules are agreed on by users and app builders. There’s no central corporation in charge.

To understand why millions of people are using Ethereum across the world, we need to look at its core mission…

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/ethereum-basics-b2e09ce5.png)

# A Global Town Square

Over the last forty years, the internet has become the town square of the world.

This online world allows total strangers to meet to exchange information, goods and services, or to build relationships, businesses and even social movements together. It’s the greatest intersection of social connection, expression and innovation that humanity has ever had.

**But it has one big problem…**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/a-global-town-square-07dbdabd.svg)

# Centralized Services

**The internet relies on a small group of corporations that don’t always have our best interests at heart.**

These `centralized services` have slowly grown an unprecedented control over the internet, because they act as `intermediaries` between most internet interactions.

Think your bank and Visa/Mastercard managing your purchases, Meta managing your social interactions, and Apple/Google managing your use of apps. As intermediaries, these businesses also take part in the trade, with their own rules, fees and intentions. 

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/centralized-services-8d33e63d.svg)

# One-sided Trades

We call them `centralized services` because all the power is in one place. It’s often like being stuck under the rule of a King who isn’t interested in your needs, and knows how to get what he wants from you. You might be surprised at the reality of your trades…

💸 Banks charge fees, then invest your savings for their own profit.

💳 Payment networks, like Visa & Mastercard, sell your purchase data to advertisers.

📞 Social platforms, like Instagram, can view your private conversations.

🪓 Content platforms, like YouTube, can freely delete creators’ entire careers — with no fair trial.

The rules and fees of these trades are often unclear, and tend to get worse over time. Take a closer look at your trades with your favourite internet businesses here: [https://tosdr.org/](https://tosdr.org/)

# Knowledge Check 1

Intermediaries manage our internet interactions on our behalf.

- [ ] True

> …

- [ ] False

# An Open Internet

😤 **Had enough of platforms that don’t respect your needs?**

---

These are the `value-extractive` services we’ve become used to.

Called “walled gardens” for how restrictive they are and how difficult they make it to leave, finding better services can be time consuming and expensive. It often feels easier to just put up with the high fees, lack of transparency, and one-sided trades. 

But doesn’t it feel like this problem is just getting worse over time?

We need more fair and reliable internet — where the technology forces services to respect your needs, and switching providers is easy. We need to go beyond intermediaries and their walled gardens.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/an-open-internet-e7f3fbda.svg)

# Peer-to-Peer Trades

The solution starts with changing how the internet is connected. Introducing `peer-to-peer` networking:

In traditional internet services, information or money from one `peer` goes through an `intermediary` before arriving at its destination. Theoretically, these intermediaries can do whatever they want before the trade is complete.
_Peer →_ _Intermediary_ _→ Peer_

Peer-to-peer services, on the other hand, remove the need for intermediaries by replacing them with automated, transparent processes.
_Peer → Automation → Peer_

It’s like replacing a shop owner with a high-tech vending machine. Services become more predictable, fees go down, and users regain control of their interactions. **As we’ll see, this fundamental shift changes everything…**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/peer-to-peer-trades-de8d8bb2.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

How does removing intermediaries improve the reliability of online interactions?

- [ ] By increasing costs.

> …

- [ ] By reducing opportunities for unexpected changes.

# Ethereum: An Open Internet

⚖️ **Would you prefer an internet where no user, shop, or landlord is above the rules?**

---

Think of Ethereum like an automated shopping mall, owned and run by its community.

“High-tech vending machines” have replaced traditional shops. Their programming is publicly available; Users can view the terms of their trade or audit the machine’s business practices.

Every transaction in the mall is tracked on a public record called the `Ethereum blockchain`. It keeps track of who owns what in the mall, removing the need for another classic intermediary — the bank!

Even the "landlord" role is played by the community. Rules are decided on by active participants, and the network is kept running by a small tax on each transaction.

On Ethereum, nobody is above the rules.

# The Decentralized Economy

To log into Ethereum you’ll use your computer or mobile device’s web browser. You’ll only need one account for the entirety of this new internet — a single login called a `crypto wallet`. This makes it easier to change services and escape “walled garden” ecosystems.

With the Ethereum app layer enabled, new websites with Ethereum functionality immediately grant you access to a limitless range of new digital goods, and automated services called `dApps`. There are dApps for:

- 🤝 sending or trading currencies, stocks and other digital goods, with low fees and 24/7 service.
- 📻 direct connection with your favourite creators, where you can unlock unique perks and opportunities while ensuring your money goes directly to the artist.
- 👪 social media, but if you dislike the platform you can easily transfer your social circle to a new one.
- 🗳️ donating to your favourite projects, where even $1 can receive a large matching bonus.
- ⚙️ renting out your computer’s processing power for passive income.

By removing intermediaries, banks, landlords, and individual accounts for each service, Ethereum has built a `decentralized` economy. In this market, services get better and better as they compete on quality — not unclear business practices and control.

# Using a dApp

1. Visit website
2. Connect wallet…
3. Select to & from tokens
4. Submit swap
5. Review terms of trade
6. Sign & execute
7. Receive tokens

# Knowledge Check 3

How does Ethereum’s market model give you greater online freedom?

- [ ] Automated services have less control over the user.

> …

- [ ] Transparent business practices make services more predictable.

> …

- [ ] A single login makes it easy to switch services.

> …

- [ ] All of the above.

# A Global Banking System

⌛ **Do you want a faster, cheaper way to transfer money?**

---

Ethereum’s automated services are far more efficient than their intermediary competitors. Better services, lower costs. This includes the network’s banking system, powered by `blockchain` and `cryptocurrency`.

⚡ Cryptocurrency can be sent internationally for as little as $0.01, settling in seconds. Compare this to an international wire transfer, where the bank can take 3-4% of your transfer in fees, and take 1-5 working days!

🔐 You’re the only person with access to your Ethereum bank account. There’s no intermediary loaning out your savings or controlling what you do with your money. Funds are held on the `Ethereum blockchain`, accessed through your `cryptocurrency wallet`.

On Ethereum, you’re your own bank, and you feel it!

# Sending a Payment

1. Open wallet
2. Send function
3. Enter address, select token
4. Review details
5. Sign & send

# How it Works

- Let’s see how that money was sent
- Replacing centralized, server-based services with peer2peer blockchains.

# Common Questions

# An Infinite Garden

Throughout this lesson, we’ve seen:

- 💰 `Intermediaries` have created one-sided services that take advantage of the user.
- ⚖️ Ethereum replaces intermediaries with more reliable `dApps` and `cryptocurrencies`.
- 📱 An `open internet` means better services at a lower cost.

---

**But it’s more important than that.**

Ethereum has changed the game of economic `value-extraction`. It erodes the walls that intermediaries have put up around their corners of the internet, and creates an economic game of `value-creation`.

The Ethereum Foundation calls this limitless, fertile ground, “The Infinite Garden”. Online services are incentivized to share their work and support innovation. Marketplace rules are agreed on by everyone. Newcomers are given ample opportunity to thrive.

The Infinite Garden returns creativity, innovation and freedom to the internet.
