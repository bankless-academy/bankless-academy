# Ethereum Basics

Welcome, Explorer, to one of the most important lessons at Bankless Academy. 

Today we’re looking at Ethereum: the next era of the internet. It’s a community-run platform powering a world of new internet `apps` and `cryptocurrencies`.

A simple way to think of Ethereum is like the Google or Apple `app store`, but with some key differences:

- 💸 It uses a new type of programmable money called cryptocurrency.
- 📡 It plugs into your internet browser, unlocking new apps directly on websites.
- ⚖️ The rules are agreed on by users and app builders. There’s no central corporation in charge.

To understand why millions of people are using Ethereum across the world, we need to look at its core mission…

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/ethereum-basics-b2e09ce5.png)

# A Global Town Square

Over the last forty years, the internet has become the town square of the world.

This online world allows total strangers to meet to exchange information, goods and services, or to build relationships, businesses and even social movements together. It’s the greatest intersection of social connection, expression and innovation that humanity has ever had.

**But it has one big problem…**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/a-global-town-square-07dbdabd.svg)

# Centralized Services

**The internet relies on a small group of corporations that don’t always have our best interests at heart.**

These `centralized services` have slowly grown an unprecedented control over the internet, because they act as `intermediaries` between most internet interactions.

Think your bank and Visa/Mastercard managing your purchases, Meta managing your social interactions, and Apple/Google managing your use of apps. As intermediaries, these businesses also take part in the trade, with their own rules, fees and intentions. 

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/centralized-services-8d33e63d.svg)

# One-sided Trades

We call them `centralized services` because all the power is in one place. It’s often like being stuck under the rule of a King who knows exactly how to get what he wants from you. You might be surprised at the reality of your trades…

💸 Banks charge fees, then invest your savings for their own profit.

💳 Payment networks, like Visa & Mastercard, sell your purchase data to advertisers.

📞 Social platforms, like Instagram, can view your private conversations.

🪓 Content platforms, like YouTube, can freely delete creators’ entire careers — with no fair trial.

These shady rules and fees are often hidden away in the ‘Terms & Conditions’. Take a closer look at your favourite service agreements here: [https://tosdr.org/](https://tosdr.org/) 👀

# Knowledge Check 1

Intermediaries manage our internet interactions on our behalf.

# An Open Internet

😤 **Had enough of platforms that don’t respect your needs?**

---

This is the `value-extractive` environment we’ve become used to.

Called “walled gardens” for how restrictive they are and how difficult they make it to leave, finding better services can be time consuming and expensive. It often feels easier to just put up with the high fees, lack of transparency, and one-sided trades.

But doesn’t it feel like this problem is just getting worse over time?

We need a fairer, more reliable internet, beyond intermediaries and their walled gardens. We need an online space where power is held by the user — the way the internet was initially built to be.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/an-open-internet-e7f3fbda.svg)

# Peer-to-Peer Trades

The solution starts with changing how the internet is connected.

In traditional internet services, information or money from one `peer` goes through an `intermediary` checkpoint before arriving at its destination. Theoretically, these intermediaries can do whatever they want before the trade is complete.

**Peer →** **Intermediary** **→ Peer**

But there’s a second model of computer interaction, called `peer-to-peer` networking. It replaces intermediary services with automated, transparent processes, using computer code.

**Peer → Automation → Peer**

It’s like replacing your intermediary with a high-tech vending machine. Code, not kings. Services become more predictable, fees go down, and users regain control over their interactions.

As we’ll see, a peer-to-peer internet changes everything.

# Knowledge Check 2

How does removing intermediaries improve the reliability of online interactions?

- [ ] By increasing costs.

- [ ] By reducing opportunities for unexpected changes.

# Ethereum: The Open Internet

⚖️ **Would you prefer an internet where no user or service is above the rules?**

---

Think of Ethereum like an automated shopping mall, owned and run by its community.

“High-tech vending machines” have replaced traditional services. With transparent programming, users can review trade terms, or audit the machine’s business practices.

Transactions in the mall are noted on a public record called the `Ethereum blockchain`. The blockchain tracks and stores digital property in the mall, removing the need for another classic intermediary — the bank!

Even the "landlord" role is played by the community. Rules are decided on by active participants, and a small tax on each transaction keeps things running.

On Ethereum, nobody is above the rules.

# The Decentralized Economy

To log into Ethereum you’ll use your computer or mobile device’s web browser. You’ll only need one account for the entirety of this new internet — a single login called a `crypto wallet`. This setup makes it easier to change services and escape “walled gardens”.

With the Ethereum app layer enabled, new websites with Ethereum functionality immediately grant you access to a limitless range of new digital goods, and automated services called `dApps`. There are dApps for:

- 🤝 sending or trading currencies, stocks and other digital goods, with low fees and 24/7 service.
- 📻 direct connection with your favourite creators, where you can unlock unique perks and opportunities while ensuring your money goes directly to the artist.
- 👪 social media, but if you dislike the platform you can easily transfer your social circle to a new one.
- 🗳️ donating to your favourite projects, where even $1 can receive a large matching bonus.
- ⚙️ renting out your computer’s processing power for passive income.

By removing intermediaries, banks, landlords, and individual accounts for each service, Ethereum has built a `decentralized` economy. In this market, services get better and better as they compete on quality — not unclear business practices, and control.

# Using a dApp

1. Visit website
2. Connect wallet…
3. Select to & from tokens
4. Submit swap
5. Review terms of trade
6. Sign & execute
7. Receive tokens

# Knowledge Check 3

How does Ethereum’s market model give you greater online freedom?

- [ ] Automated services have less control over the user.

> …

- [ ] Transparent business practices make services more predictable.

> …

- [ ] A single login makes it easy to switch services.

> …

- [ ] All of the above.

# A Global Banking System

⌛ **Do you want a faster, cheaper way to transfer money internationally?**

---

Ethereum’s automated services are far more efficient than their intermediary competitors. Better services, lower costs. This includes the network’s banking system, powered by `blockchain` and `cryptocurrency`.

⚡ Cryptocurrency can be sent anywhere for as little as $0.01, settling in seconds. Compare this to an international wire transfer, where banks charge 3-4% of your transfer in fees, and take 1-5 working days!

🔐 You’re the only person with access to your Ethereum bank account. There’s no intermediary loaning out your savings or controlling what you do with your money. Funds are held on the `Ethereum blockchain`, accessed through your `cryptocurrency wallet`.

On Ethereum, you’re your own bank, and you feel it!

# Sending a Payment

1. Open wallet
2. Send function
3. Enter address, select token
4. Review details
5. Sign & send

# How it Works

Let’s bring it all together by looking under the hood. As a `peer-to-peer` network, Ethereum is made up of computers spread across the world. These devices have been volunteered to run the network by their owners. Using automated software, these `validators` process transactions, check the results of others to negate fraud, and generate `ether` rewards for their owners.

Your decentralized transaction is processed by validators on the network:

1. Your ETH transaction is submitted to the Ethereum Network.
2. A validator checks your transaction for errors. Other validators double-check their results.
3. If approved, your transaction is added to the network ledger, the `Ethereum blockchain`.
4. The recipient receives your transferred ETH in their wallet.

This transaction process is very similar when interacting with dApps, with a few added steps and connections. We’ll save the details for a future lesson.
