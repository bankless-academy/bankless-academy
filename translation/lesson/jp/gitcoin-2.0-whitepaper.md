# White Paper Lesson | Gitcoin = Grants = Growth

Welcome to the revolution in capital allocation.

In this lesson, we delve into the Gitcoin 2.0 white paper to explore innovative approaches to public goods funding and Ethereum ecosystem growth.

Having surpassed $60 million in funding distributed, Gitcoin is at the forefront of a movement towards more democratic, efficient, and transparent capital allocation on web3.

Anyone can check out the white paper for an in-depth look at how we are refining capital allocation with Allo Protocol: https://www.gitcoin.co/whitepaper/read.

Thank you to the curators of this lesson, Ornella & Didier from Bankless Academy, and Harry, Caolán & Cici from Gitcoin.

# Introduction to Quadratic Funding

If you’re here you may know already, but here’s a refresher.

Quadratic Funding (QF) originated from the ideas of Glenn Weyl and Vitalik Buterin. It's a mechanism designed to allocate funds in a fair and democratic manner by leveraging matching funds to amplify the impact of small individual contributions.

We debuted QF at Gitcoin Grants (GG), a pivotal moment enabling democratic donations to projects that matter. We continue to finely tune the QF model with each iteration since GG Round 1 launched in 2019.

We have found our rhythm with Gitcoin 2.0, extending further into the grants space to include funding mechanisms like Direct Grants and delivering a more decentralized, modular experience.

_add as a reference: QF amplifies available resources with individual donations of any size acting as votes. The broader the support, the bigger the impact!_

# Our role in the Ethereum ecosystem

Gitcoin has disbursed grants to open source software (OSS) teams since 2019, running a major round almost every quarter.

Although rounds sizes ebb and flow depending on market cycles and participating project maturity, these rounds are an important touchstone for the open source Ethereum  community.

Prior to GG20, Gitcoin distributed $8.4M to ~2500 applicants through four main rounds on Allo. These rounds have been deployed on a variety of chains, from Ethereum mainnet to L2s such as Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as side chains like Fantom and Polygon.

# … and there’s more!

Gitcoin's dynamics most often reward projects that play the long game — that is, projects that appear consistently throughout grants rounds, making connections and building a following.

A large part of Gitcoin's project base comes from the open source community, with developer activity of 50 OSS projects associated with at least five GG rounds receiving a total of $9.4M.

The most interesting finding is the correlation between GG rounds and developer growth. Overall, we see that there has been $135K in grant funding allocated per full-time developer.

In other words, for every $1M that has been paid out in grants since 2019, there are 7.4 full-time developers who are still around today. If we factor in the crowdfund multiplier of 0.75, then every $1M put into the matching pool correlates to 13 retained full-time developers.

# Carving a path

The recent upgrade to Gitcoin 2.0 was driven by many changes in the market, including the expansion of the Ethereum ecosystem with L2 launches, the growth of open-source development, and increasing adoption of grant programs.

# Evolutionary Development

Gitcoin’s transformation breaks down as follows:

1. Decentralized Modular Protocols: moving from a centralized, Gitcoin-operated platform to a suite of modularized products and protocols that anyone can use and build with or on top of.
2. Plural Funding Mechanics: moving from QF only to many ways of allocating capital. Our current focus is on Direct Grants, Retroactive Public Goods Funding, Streaming QF and Conviction Voting.
3. Open for EVM-Based Community: expanding beyond Ethereum-only to implementation across EVM-based networks such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, zkSync, Scroll and Avalanche.

# Knowledge Check 1

What was the initial focus of Gitcoin, before it transitioned to its 2.0 stage?

- [ ] Hackathon platform

> Right! But this isn’t the only correct answer.

- [ ] Bounty platform

> Right! But this isn’t the only correct answer.

- [ ] Quadratic Funding

> Right! But this isn’t the only correct answer.

- [ ] All of the above.

> Correct! Gitcoin technically focused on bounties, hackathons and QF before the 2.0 launch

# The Impact of Capital Allocation

The internet has introduced the ability to communicate at a incredible speed and scale.

Blockchains have created a transparent ledger to report on activities and create accountability through easy data availability and the immutability of onchain actions. Gitcoin harnesses the positive attributes of both to address the following capital allocation issues:

1. Gatekeeping: using small groups of decision makers, who may otherwise become power brokers and are unwilling or unable to be democratic.
2. Not Scalable: taking advantage of the primitives the internet (easy access, direct to consumer interfaces) and Ethereum (credible neutrality, composability, transparency, democratic decision making, censorship resistance) have to offer.
3. Not Precise: by programmatically managing large amounts of information at scale, enabling high resolution capital allocation.

# Expanding beyond EVM

Allo’s simple, generalized architecture that allows it to be easily customized for a wide range of use cases, supporting many different types of capital allocation.

The power of Allo is on display in its ability to deepen impact by precisely allocating capital at scale. There are three key components to the protocol:

There are three key components to the protocol:

1. Tokens: funding sources sending tokens into a pool.
2. Registry: structuring data of possible participants that are eligible for distribution of tokens.
3. Strategy: designating how tokens will be allocated and distributed to recipients.

# Grants Stack & other use cases

Grants Stack, built on top of Allo Protocol, is the primary application in the Gitcoin ecosystem.

Grants Stack is designed to be a trustworthy, enterprise-grade tool that grants customers can rely on. It also serves as a reference app for Allo Protocol builders as it is open-source and forkable.

Grants Stack invests in several core areas to provide grants managers with the tools they need to run successful grants programs.

# Grants Stack & other use cases continued

Grants Stack currently supports multiple funding methods: Quadratic Funding and Direct Grants.

As new funding mechanisms arise, we look to gain enough expertise in them to integrate them to our product suite.

A relevant example of this is EasyRetroPGF.xyz. Originally deployed by Optimism, we’ve now open-sourced the tool to be hosted and run by anyone in the web3 grants community.

It will be exciting to see complimentary applications emerge, such as reporting and discovery tools, as well as no coding tools like EasyRetroPGF.xyz. These create a flywheel of innovation in the grants ecosystem that allows Grants Stack to remain a stable, trusted solution while staying at the forefront of grants innovation.
