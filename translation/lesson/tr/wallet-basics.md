# Cüzdana Giriş

**Greetings Bankless Explorer!**

Blok zinciri çoklu evrenine yolculuğunuzda daha derinlere dalmanın zamanı geldi. Bu ekosistemdeki her Kaşifin eninde sonunda bir kripto para cüzdanı oluşturması gerekir.

Wallets are kind of like the accounts from the `web2` internet that you’re used to. `Web3` olarak da bilinen blok zinciri ekosistemine giriş yapmak için bir cüzdan oluşturacak, bu cüzdan ile `kripto para` kullanabilecek ve `blok zinciri uygulamaları`na bağlanabileceksiniz!

Bu derste size cüzdanları, nasıl çalıştıklarını ve kripto paranızı nasıl güvende tutacağınızı anlatacağız. Nasıl cüzdan oluşturacağınıza ve **Bankless Academy'nin evi olan Ethereum blok zinciri**ne nasıl erişeceğinize dair bir kılavuzla dersi tamamlayacağız.

# Cüzdanın Tanımı

Kripto cüzdanı tam olarak nedir?

Kısa tanımı şöyle yapabiliriz: Dijital varlıkları saklamak ve blok zinciri uygulamalarına giriş yapmak için kullanılan, `blok zinciri` üzerindeki bir hesap.

Bu, internette kendinize ait şahsi kasanızın olması ve kilidini açan tek anahtarın sizde bulunmasına benziyor. Bu kasa, aynı zamanda, normal bir web sitesi hesabına da benzer. Onu alışveriş yapmak, `kripto para` göndermek veya almak ve bir blok zinciri ile etkileşim kurmak için kullanabilirsiniz.

Ancak, alışkın olduğunuz `web2` hesaplarının aksine, tek bir cüzdan tüm blok zincirine ve çok sayıda blok zinciri uygulamasına erişebiliyor. Tüm internet için tek bir hesaba sahip olmak gibi.

# Cüzdan oluşturmak zor mu?

Önceden zordu ancak bugünlerde herkes oldukça kolay bir şekilde cüzdan oluşturabiliyor.

Bilgisayarınıza yazılım (veya telefonunuza uygulama) indirme ve yükleme konusunda rahatsanız ilk cüzdanınızı oluştururken sorun yaşamazsınız.

Bir cüzdanı kontrol etmenin en zor kısmı onu güvende tutmaktır; bu konuya birazdan değineceğiz!

Choosing your `wallet app` may also feel intimidating. This is the app that you will install on your device to access your wallet on the blockchain. We recommend starting with the Zerion wallet app: it’s user friendly and has access to many popular blockchains. As you get more comfortable in the `web3` space, you will likely explore other providers and create multiple wallets.

# Knowledge Check 1

Cüzdan nedir?

- [ ] Bir blok zinciri

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! Cüzdanınız bir blok zinciri üzerinde barındırılır.

- [ ] Bir kripto para birimi

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! Kripto para birimleri cüzdanınızda tuttuğunuz şeylerdir.

- [ ] Bir dijital koleksiyon parçası

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! Dijital koleksiyon parçaları cüzdanınızda tuttuğunuz şeylerdir.

- [ ] Bir blok zinciri hesabı

> ℹ️ Doğru! Wallets are accounts used to interact with blockchains.

# Cüzdanlar ve Parola Kurtarma

Here is one of the most important things to understand about `web3` wallets: **There are no “password resets” or “password changes”.**

Çoğumuz bu özelliklere alışkınız. If we forget a password, we click a button, do a few things, and get a new password. Kolay bir çözüm.

Not so with crypto wallets. Because of how blockchains work, wallets are assigned an “address” and a complex “password” when they’re created — and you do not choose these.

This address and password combination are impossible to change, although you can always create a new wallet if you need to. Let’s learn a bit more about these special addresses and passwords, so that we can feel confident using them!

# Cüzdanınızın açık anahtarı

A `public key` is basically your wallet’s address. Often, this looks like a random series of letters and numbers.

Örnek: _0xe1887fF140BfA9D3b45D0B2077b7471124acD242_

It is possible to create easier to remember versions of this with some `web3` services, but that’s a lesson for another time.

You can also think of a public key like a house address. Bu anahtar herkese açıktır, herkes tarafından görülebilir ve başkalarına, sizin için gönderecekleri kripto varlıkları, hakkınızda kişisel hiçbir şey ifşa etmeden nereye gönderebileceklerini söyler.

It is perfectly safe to share your wallet’s **public key**.

**Note:** A single wallet app can hold multiple public/`private key` pairs.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/your-wallets-public-key-87828c3e.svg)

# Cüzdanınızın özel anahtarı

If the public key is like a house address, then the `private key` is like the key to the front door. It’s the “password” to your funds and assets.

Example: _eceac283e04f121cbd40b69e16ab9dec0220df80bf092_

**It’s never safe to share this key — you could lose your wallet and everything in it.**

Most people recommend that you do not even save it digitally. Whoever has access to a private key has access to whatever is in the `wallet`.

This is more than just a password. You cannot reset it if you lose access to it.

Luckily, most `blockchain apps` do not require you to type a long, complicated string of characters every time you need to send funds or sign a blockchain transaction. The private key usually operates quietly in the background.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/your-wallets-private-key-0d84ad39.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

Your public key is like your _____ and your private key is like your _____ .

- [ ] Yönlendirme Numarası/Hesap Numarası

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! Unlike a bank account number, your private key shouldn’t be shared with others.

- [ ] Adres/Posta kodu

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! Unlike a zip code, your private key shouldn’t be shared with others.

- [ ] House address / House key

> ℹ️ Doğru! Your public key allows others to find you, while only your private key lets you in.

- [ ] Telefon Numarası/Pasaport Numarası

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! These are examples of public & private information, but they’re unrelated.

# Kurtarma İfadesi

When you set up a new wallet, your wallet app will provide you with a `recovery phrase`.

Also called a “seed phrase” or “secret phrase”, this string of words can be used to access your wallet and crypto assets if:

- Your `wallet app` or device fails unexpectedly or is damaged.
- Your device has been lost or stolen.
- You want to access your wallet on multiple devices.

Most recovery phrases are a list of 12 to 24 words that represent a unique piece of data. This data is used to generate both the `public key` and `private key` for your wallet.

Wallet recovery does **not** change or reset the keys.

Your recovery phrase is essentially an easier to read version of your public/private key pair. **Never share your recovery phrase.**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/recovery-phrase-c614c36c.svg)

# Knowledge Check 3

Can you access your wallet with a recovery phrase if your device gets damaged or lost?

- [ ] Hayır

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin!

- [ ] Evet

> ℹ️ Doğru! Recovery phrases grant access to your wallet, even on multiple devices.

# Cüzdan Türleri

Just as there are many types of computer software, there many types of wallet. Let’s look at the four main categories:

- 🏦 **Custodial wallets:** where a third party is responsible for your private keys.
- 👤 **Self-custody (non-custodial) wallets:** where you are responsible for your private keys.

There are two styles of `self-custody wallet`:

- 🔥 **Hot wallets:** software on your desktop or phone.
- 🧊 **Cold wallets:** a piece of hardware (like a memory stick) you store somewhere safe.

Each wallet solution serves a different use-case. Many advanced users have one of each!

Don’t worry, we’ll only be creating one wallet today.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/types-of-wallet-094f0eb1.png)

# Gözetimli Cüzdanlar

Since your `private key` unlocks access to your `wallet`, keeping it safe and secure is very important!

`Custodial wallet` services include cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken. **They are your wallet custodian** — they look after your private keys for you. You access their services like any other website (with an email login and resettable password).

This may be all some people need, but it requires you to trust these third parties to secure your crypto assets and give you access when you want to trade them or send them somewhere. Also, your access to some `blockchain apps` may be limited.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/custodial-wallets-4eede755.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

Do you control your private key with a custodial wallet?

- [ ] Evet

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin!

- [ ] Hayır

> ℹ️ Doğru! Gözetimli cüzdanlar, özel anahtarlarınızı kontrol etmesi için üçüncü bir tarafa (emanetçi) güvenmenizi gerektirir.

# Gözetimsiz Cüzdan

A `self-custody wallet` (like Zerion or Trezor) is when you fully control your `private key`. You have **no custodian**, and you alone are responsible for keeping your private key safe.

These wallets offer the widest range of access and freedom within the world of `web3`. You never have to worry about a third party freezing or mishandling your funds.

The trade-off is in risk: if you lose access to your `recovery phrase`, or your private key is compromised, there is often very little you can do to restore access to the wallet.

Whichever route you choose, it pays to be familiar and comfortable with wallet security. We’ll give you some tips before you complete this lesson.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/non-custodial-wallet-833c3d6b.svg)

# Knowledge Check 5

Are you responsible for your private key with a self-custody wallet?

- [ ] Evet

> ℹ️ Doğru! Gözetimsiz cüzdanda özel anahtarlarınızdan yalnızca siz sorumlu olursunuz.

- [ ] Hayır

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin!

# Sıcak Cüzdanlar

You will hear the terms “hot” and “cold wallet” quite a bit in `web3`.

A `hot wallet` is a wallet accessed via an app on your device — the Zerion app for example. Similar to many `web2` apps, a wallet app is consistently connected to the internet.

Your `private key` is encrypted and stored inside the wallet app, and is only accessed when you interact with the blockchain. These wallets are named ‘hot wallets’ for this “hot” connection between the internet and your private key.

Hot wallets are convenient for small day-to-day interactions, much like a physical wallet you keep in your pocket. We’ll be creating a hot wallet today!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/hot-wallets-9356886d.svg)

# Soğuk Cüzdanlar

As you dive deeper into your `web3` journey, you will come to know a landscape full of interesting tech trade-offs.

`Cold wallets` grant higher security at the cost of convenience. A cold wallet is one where your `private key` is stored on a dedicated hardware device (like a memory stick or external hard drive). You must physically connect the hardware wallet to your computer to access your wallet on the blockchain. Your private key is never directly connected to the internet. Cold wallets are named after this “cold” internet connection.

They are widely considered to be more secure than `hot wallets`, because your `private key` is stored offline — out of reach of digital attackers.

Ledger and Trezor are examples of `cold wallets`.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/cold-wallets-0e3183d1.svg)

# Knowledge Check 6

Which of the following wallet types is considered the most secure?

- [ ] All wallets are about the same

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! There are various trade-offs for each wallet type, with level of security being one of them.

- [ ] Sıcak cüzdan

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! Sıcak cüzdanın aktif bir internet bağlantısı vardır ve bu bağlantı, onu dijital saldırılara karşı daha hassas hale getirir.

- [ ] Gözetimli cüzdan

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! Özel anahtarları elinde tutan üçüncü taraf saldırıya uğrayabilir veya iflas edebilir.

- [ ] Soğuk cüzdan

> ℹ️ Doğru! Soğuk cüzdanlar aktif olarak internete bağlı değildir ve bu da onları saldırılara karşı daha dirençli hale getirir.

# Cüzdan Güvenliği

Regardless if your `self-custody wallet` is hot or cold, there are many smart security practices you should develop.

🖊️ Record your `recovery phrase` on a physical, durable material (such as laminated paper, or even steel) and store it somewhere very safe. Never share it or your `private key` with anyone. **Remember, this is more than just a password.**

🔍 When interacting with a blockchain or sending funds, even small amounts, double check the details very carefully. Incorrect details cannot be changed after an interaction.

🔭 Spend time researching and gathering info on any `blockchain apps` you plan to interact with before connecting your wallet to it or signing its transactions.

💰 Use wallets with low amounts of funds to try new things and explore web3, and consider storing high value assets across multiple wallet accounts (i.e. avoid putting all your crypto eggs in one basket).

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/wallet-security-3a185d90.png)

# Knowledge Check 7

What is the safest way to protect your recovery phrase?

- [ ] Dayanıklı bir materyalin üzerine yazın ve güvenli bir yerde saklayın.

> ℹ️ Doğru! A safely stored physical backup with no digital traces is the safest storage option.

- [ ] Bilgisayarınıza kaydedin ve çıktısını alın.

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! If your computer is hacked, your recovery phrase could be found. Çıktı almak, birçok saldırı fırsatının da önünü açar.

- [ ] Bir ekran görüntüsü alın ve telefonunuza kaydedin.

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! Telefonunuz saldırıya uğrarsa cüzdanınızdaki tüm varlıkları kaybedebilirsiniz.

- [ ] Save it in your password manager.

> ℹ️ Tekrar deneyin! If your password manager is hacked, your recovery phrase could be leaked.

# İlk cüzdanınızı oluşturmaya hazırsınız!

In fact, you’ll need one if you want to claim proof of completing this quest!
