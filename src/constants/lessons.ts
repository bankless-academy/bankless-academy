Every block must be linked to the previous one by referencing the previous block’s unique identifier, its block hash. This prevents fraud by ensuring past blocks (and the transactions within them) can’t be changed. They are chained together to form one connected blockchain.</p></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/lesson/blockchain-fundamentals/inside-a-block-a25188c4.png\'></div>'
