    "articleContent": "This is a summary of our [Wallet Basics](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics) lesson, along with a walkthrough for the quest. Check out [the full lesson](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics) to **level up your knowledge and claim your badge!**\n\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n> * You‚Äôll need a `crypto wallet` to access the world of blockchains!\n>\n> * A wallet is like a `blockchain` account.\n>\n> * Wallets are used to store `cryptocurrency`, log into blockchain apps, and more.\n>\n> * These wallets work on both computers and phones.\n>\n> * Creating a wallet is easy and takes around 5 minutes. We‚Äôll show you how, in our video below!\n\n## What is a Crypto Wallet?\n\nCrypto wallets are an essential piece of web3 equipment, allowing you to use `cryptocurrency` on your computer or phone. Wallets are accessed using software called a `wallet app` ‚Äî a web browser extension for your computer, or an app on your phone.\n\nIt gets better. Wallets are more than accounts for holding cryptocurrency ‚Äî they‚Äôre our connection to the blockchain. We can use them to exchange cryptocurrency with others, log into blockchain applications, **and even collect digital items like Bankless Academy badges.** The more we explore, the more our wallets become ‚Äî with some viewing them as the beginning of digital identity.\n\nWallets come with two core pieces of account information:\n\n* A `public key`, that you can think of as your *username*. You‚Äôll share it publicly to receive cryptocurrency.\n\n* A `private key`, acting as your *password*. This should always be kept private, and cannot be changed.\n\nProtecting your private key is critical because this key grants instant access to your wallet. You should never share your private key. You can learn more by taking [the full lesson](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics).\n\nToday we will set up our first wallet, using our recommended crypto wallet: Zerion!\n\n## Walkthrough\n\nSet up your first wallet on your computer, using the walkthrough below, or keep scrolling for our phone wallet walkthrough.\n\n### Computer Wallet\n\n[youtube-embed](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/czL_qQ39AH0)\n\n### Phone Wallet\n\n[youtube-embed](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFbo9QsO2t4)\n\n\n---\n\n**It‚Äôs time to join the blockchain multiverse!**\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to collect this handbook entry for easy reference on your travels, and to support Bankless Academy.\n\nSafe travels, Explorer!\n\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What is a cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrencies are a form of digital money, secured by `cryptography`. These currencies can run without the need for centralized authorities and banks, reducing possibility for fraud while increasing the financial freedom of the holder.\n\nLearn more about cryptocurrency through our **[Bitcoin Basics](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/bitcoin-basics)** lesson, and see how these digital currencies are revolutionizing the financial world!\n\n### What are public and private keys?\n\nPublic/private key `encryption` allows your wallet to make some information public, like the address where others can send cryptocurrency to you, while keeping access to your cryptocurrency private. One key is like your cryptocurrency‚Äôs house address, and the other unlocks the front door.\n\nYou can share your public key with anyone you trust to send you cryptocurrency, but your private key is for your eyes only ‚Äî because it grants access to all assets inside the wallet. Never share it, even if your contact claims to be from Bankless Academy or Zerion.\n\nLearn more and get rewarded for creating your first wallet, in our [Wallet Basics](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics) lesson.\n\n### What happens if I lose my recovery phrase?\n\nYour recovery phrase, also known as a ‚Äúsecret phrase‚Äù or ‚Äúseed phrase‚Äù, is your only backup if you lose access to your wallet on your device. If you lose your recovery phrase, your wallet‚Äôs holdings will be lost forever. This is why it‚Äôs important to store it somewhere safe ‚Äî from not only theft or loss, but fire or water damage too.\n\n### Can Ethereum wallets hold Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum wallets can hold Bitcoin, but in a ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù form. If you want to hold original Bitcoin, you‚Äôll have to create a wallet that runs on the Bitcoin network, like [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/) or [Mycelium](https://wallet.mycelium.com/).\n\n\n---\n\n**Author**\n\n[Tetranome](https://twitter.com/Tetranome) is the Content & Design Lead at Bankless Academy, focusing on the learning journey, user interface & experience, and platform artwork.\n\n**Patron**\n\nThis walkthrough is powered by Zerion.",

We will explore them in more detail in our Layer 2 lesson.</p><p><code>Sharding</code> splits the single blockchain into multiple chains that all run together in parallel, like adding more lanes to a road. It enables more transactions to be processed at once without sacrificing security or decentralization.</p></div><div class=\"bloc2\"><img src='/images/layer-1-blockchains/so-what-can-be-done-043c43fb.svg'></div>"

    "articleContent": "## Key Takeaways\n\n> * There are a number of ways to fund your wallet on an Ethereum scaling solution like Optimism, Arbitrum, or Polygon.\n>\n> * Centralized exchanges often provide a direct Layer 2 onramp.\n>\n> * Third-party payment apps enable users to fund a wallet on Layer 2 from a bank account or a debit or credit card.\n>\n> * Protocol bridges let users send funds from Ethereum Mainnet to Layer 2.\n\nIf you‚Äôre new to crypto, all the talk about the importance of `Layer 2` (or L2) must seem a bit odd, confusing really. In contrast to [Layer 1](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/layer-1-blockchains), which often refers to [Ethereum Mainnet](https://ethereum.org/), Layer 2 is a term for a specific type of Ethereum scaling solution that enables users to inherit the security of Ethereum but enjoy low transaction fees and fast `block` inclusion times. If you‚Äôve ever heard of [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), or [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (which is really a side chain, but let‚Äôs not worry about that here), those are Layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nWhen the Ethereum network is busy, it can cost the equivalent of 80 USD in transaction fees ‚Äî known as `gwei` or gas ‚Äî to swap tokens, and much more to mint NFTs or provide `liquidity` to a `decentralized exchange` (DEX) on Mainnet. When network activity is low, most transactions on Ethereum Mainnet still cost a few dollars, and it takes an [FTX-level debacle](https://www.investopedia.com/ftx-exchange-5200842) or a [beyond-hyped NFT drop](https://dappradar.com/blog/yuga-labs-600m-otherside-nft-land-sale-records-highest-gas-fees-ever-on-ethereum) to really spike transaction fees.\n\nBecause transactions on Layer 2 confirm quickly and are inexpensive to execute, many of the most innovative protocols are building on L2s. Unless you‚Äôve been in the ecosystem for a while, however, it‚Äôs not intuitive to know how to start using Layer 2s. But there is a clear place to begin your journey into Ethereum scaling solutions: funding your `wallet` on Layer 2.\n\nThere are three main ways to fund an L2 wallet: moving your crypto from a `centralized exchange` straight to a Layer 2 network, using a third-party crypto payment service to fund an L2 wallet, or sending your digital assets from Mainnet to L2 via a bridging protocol.\n\n> Please note, you‚Äôll need to have a cryptocurrency wallet, like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Tally Ho](https://tallyho.org/), and an Ethereum wallet `address` to proceed. If you haven‚Äôt yet created a `non-custodial wallet`, please [take this lesson first](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics)!\n>\n> After you have a non-custodial Ethereum wallet address, you‚Äôll be ready to continue on your crypto journey.\n\n## Funding From CEXs\n\nFunding your wallet directly from a centralized exchange (CEX) is perhaps the simplest way to move digital assets to an L2, particularly if you already hold cryptocurrency on the exchange. Most major CEXs offer users this option, although it isn‚Äôt always clear to the user.\n\nOn [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), for example, users can send their funds directly to Optimism or Polygon in just a few steps:\n\n1\\. Go to [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/).\n\n2\\. [Purchase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-do-i-buy-digital-currency) or hold ETH on Coinbase.\n\n3\\. Select ‚ÄòSend & Receive‚Äô, located at the top of the website.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-06c6d84b.png)\n\n4\\. Enter the amount in fiat or ETH you wish to send (you can toggle between fiat and crypto to the right of the amount), select ‚ÄòPay with‚Äô and choose Ethereum, and in the ‚ÄòTo‚Äô field, enter the wallet address where the funds will be sent. Select ‚ÄòContinue‚Äô.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-11e1d7f9.png)\n\n5\\. On the next screen, select ‚ÄòNetwork‚Äô and change the network from Ethereum to Optimism.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-c8d4dd72.png)\n\n6\\. Review, and if accurate, select ‚ÄòSend Now‚Äô.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-9598ee73.png)\n\nMost major exchanges offer users the ability to send their crypto directly to an L2. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) supports Optimism and Arbitrum, for example. On whatever centralized exchange you convert fiat to crypto, check to see whether it offers support for direct-to-L2 services. Pro Tip: Use [Blockscan](https://blockscan.com/exchanges) to find the exchange compatible with your preferred L2.\n\n## Third-Party Onramps\n\nAnother simple way to fund your L2 wallet is to take advantage of direct-to-L2 services offered by many third-party crypto payment companies. [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/), [Ramp](https://ramp.network/buy/), and [Transak](https://global.transak.com/) are three of the most popular options to fund crypto wallets without having to use a centralized exchange.\n\nLike most exchanges, these third-party onramps will require you to provide Know-Your-Customer information. However, once you get past those basic hurdles, these payment options are an easy way to buy crypto across the ecosystem and transfer it to Layer 2.\n\nFor MoonPay, the steps are:\n\n1\\. Go to [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/).\n\n2\\. Select ‚ÄòBuy crypto‚Äô, located at the top or middle of the website.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-4f0d6a11.png)\n\n3\\. Enter the amount of fiat you wish to send and the proper denomination.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-386958ca.png)\n\n4\\. Select a digital asset, in this case ETH. Type in ‚ÄúETH'‚Äú and you will see different networks on which you can purchase ETH (you may need to scroll down); choose the Layer 2 you want to use. Click ‚ÄòContinue‚Äô.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-fe6487dc.png)\n\n5\\. Next, you will be prompted to enter personal verification and payment data.\n\n6\\. Once complete, enter your Ethereum wallet address. You‚Äôll be asked to make sure the wallet is safe to use.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-138ee98b.png)\n\n7\\. Complete, confirm the information is correct, and select ‚ÄòPay‚Äô.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-99952ff9.png)\n\nAs with CEXs, most major third-party payment onramps provide direct-to-L2 functionality. Take advantage of these innovations to save on transaction fees and increase the range of your `blockchain` explorations.\n\n## Funding Via Bridges\n\nIf you already have funds on Ethereum Mainnet, by far the easiest way to get your crypto on to L2 is to use a bridging protocol. Bridges are the name we‚Äôve given to protocols designed to help us move our funds around the cryptoverse, and there are a number of bridges designed to move crypto from Ethereum Mainnet to Layer 2s.\n\n### Native Bridges\n\nNative bridges are those designed by the Layer 2 protocols themselves. For true Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, it takes about 30 minutes to move funds onto L2, but one week to move that crypto back over to Mainnet. The [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) and the [Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/) both take longer to transfer assets and settle transactions because of the way the scaling solution is designed.\n\n### Third-Party Bridges\n\nBecause no one likes to wait, a number of third-party bridging services exist to help us move our funds instantly to and from L2s. Among the most popular options are [Hop Protocol](https://app.hop.exchange/) and [Across Protocol](https://across.to/bridge), but you can use [Bungee](https://bungee.exchange/) to compare bridging fees across a number of protocols. To use Across, for example, all you need to do is:\n\n1\\. Go to the [Across Protocol](https://across.to/bridge) bridge and connect your wallet.\n\n2\\. To bridge funds to L2, select Ethereum under ‚ÄòFrom‚Äô.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-0f4e1bde.png)\n\n3\\. Choose your asset and the amount you wish to bridge (Pro Tip: only bridge a blockchain‚Äôs native `coin`, in this case ETH).\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-659f509f.png)\n\n4\\. Next, select your L2 solution in ‚ÄòTo‚Äô.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FMnz8fWPFIGGQp25RA6FKt.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n5\\. Review the transaction, and if all looks correct, select ‚ÄòSend‚Äô.\n\n![](/images/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2/image-8d84ca0b.png)\n\nMoving funds from Mainnet to L2 is really that simple, and nearly all bridges work the same way. Select a blockchain to send funds from and your destination, pick an asset and amount, and across the blockchain crevice you go. Pro Tip: As with sending from a CEX, you can use [Blockscan](https://blockscan.com/bridges) to find a compatible bridge for your L2 destination.\n\n## The Road to L2\n\nLayer 2s offer users of all experience levels the opportunity to experiment with decentralized finance in a way that is often prohibitive on Mainnet. Because it costs mere pennies to transact on these networks (you can compare costs [here](https://l2fees.info/)), it‚Äôs a great place to become familiar with the basic building blocks of decentralized finance, such as swaps, `liquidity pools`, or yield farms.\n\nUsing a CEX or a bridge to move funds to L2 is a necessary step in your journey from crypto novice to crypto competency. Remember, to see your funds displayed in your wallet, you may need to add the network in your wallet settings, which can be done at [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/). If you just want to check that the funds made it safely to your L2 wallet, you can also check Etherscan (click on the ‚Äòb‚Äô for ‚ÄòBlockscan‚Äô to the right of your wallet address to see L2 transactions) or go to a DEX, like [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/), and select the L2 network and the asset to see your balance.\n\nAs you scale up your skills, you‚Äôll need to figure out how to scale down your transaction fees. Learning how to fund an L2 wallet is the first step, but the next steps on your crypto journey are up to you. Welcome, explorer, a new world awaits.\n\n\n---\n\nLet‚Äôs get moving, Layer 2 Ethereum awaits!

    "slug": "registering-your-web3-username",
    "articleContent": "## Key Takeaways\n\n> * Using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), you can create a single username that represents you across multiple blockchains.\n>\n> * ENS names simplify sending and receiving `cryptocurrency` by replacing your lengthy wallet address with a memorable label like *web3explorer.eth*\n>\n> * Your ENS names become associated with your online presence: your cryptocurrency portfolio, your blockchain interactions, social media pages, avatars, websites, and emails, forming a single `onchain identity`.\n>\n> * Registering an ENS name is similar to registering a .com website address. It requires a `cryptocurrency wallet` and 10 minutes.\n\n## Introducing Universal Usernames\n\nImagine having a single username for the entire internet. One account for your entire online presence ‚Äî an account that you own and plug into other apps across the internet. This username would serve as your digital personality, allowing you to be recognized across the internet, making you a unique, memorable member of the online community.\n\nProjects like the [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://ens.domains) are building this single username reality, leveraging the powers of cryptocurrency wallets. Using ENS, your `custodial wallet` address can be transformed into a personalized address of your choosing, with a `.eth` extension.\n\n*0xB00e26E79352882391604E24b371A3F3c8658e8c* ‚Üí *web3explorer.eth*\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-c7baff43.png)\n\nJust like a .com website address, it‚Äôs easy to read, memorable, and personalized to you. No matter where on the internet you are, your name will be consistent and recognizable. Sending `cryptocurrency` to your wallet no longer requires saving, copying and pasting a lengthy address.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning.\n\n> *Originally we envisioned ENS as a naming system to name crypto addresses.. (but) as web3 users, the meaning of an address is so much more, it can be your Farcaster id, your crypto payment address, a DAO contract and more.*\n>\n> *The use cases of web3 are expanding and if we want the next billion people to be onboarded onto web3, it needs to be usable. When all these things are properly named, web3 becomes usable, it becomes human.*\n>\n> *ENS makes web3 human.*\n>\n> *‚Äî Jefflau.eth, Core Developer at ENS Labs*\n\nBy linking your wallet address to a unique .eth username, you‚Äôve actually created a web3 personality with the ownership powers of a custodial wallet. ENS names can support wallets across multiple networks. One universal name is now linked to your digital property across blockchains, your blockchain history, and more. This includes any special credentials you may have unlocked ‚Äî **like your Bankless Academy badges.**\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-c55c7950.png)\n\n## Onchain Identity\n\nThe capabilities of ENS extend beyond labelling wallet addresses; ENS can label almost any entity or asset on the blockchain, like a `smart contract`, and point to any location on the `web2` internet. Your website, social media profiles, and email can all be associated with this single username.\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-7086002e.png)\n\nPicture ENS as **your onchain passport**. A physical passport contains your name, photo, birth date, and passport number, linking to extensive information in your government‚Äôs identity database. ENS maps your .eth domain (`yourname.eth`) with an Ethereum address, a profile picture, `onchain` data like trades and governance votes, and `offchain` data like your website.\n\nHere‚Äôs the key difference: You own and control all aspects of this onchain passport.\n\nENS names are represented as NFT tokens (`ERC-721` tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain, which are owned by and managed through your custodial wallet ‚Äî **just like cryptocurrency.** In web3, you can truly own your online identity and carry it with you around the internet. Your account ‚Äî its data, content, followers etc. ‚Äî can‚Äôt be erased by the platforms you use. We‚Äôre moving beyond the control of YouTube, Instagram, and the other web2 giants managing the internet community.\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-073b8d76.png)\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at how our ENS names plug into onchain apps, starting with the Bankless Academy ‚ÄòExplorer Profile‚Äô feature. As a Bankless Academy user with an ENS name, you will automatically find your ENS name and profile picture represented on [your profile](https://app.banklessacademy.com/explorer/my-profile). This information is displayed alongside your Academy achievements ‚Äî like lesson badges and collected content.\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-09c3d858.png)\n\nAnother example is Farcaster, a decentralized social network. Instead of requiring users to create a new social account, it allows them to connect their wallet and leverage their existing ENS name along with its associated data. This approach enriches the Farcaster social graph with existing information, showcasing practicality of ENS in decentralized identity management.\n\n> **Fun fact:** As of this writing, ENS has registered nearly 2,070,797 domains, as per [Dune Analytics data](https://dune.com/ethereumnameservice/ens). That‚Äôs close to the population of Houston, Texas. üêÇ\n\nIt's time to become an onchain citizen and shape our decentralized future. It‚Äôs time to register your ENS name. We'll guide you through the process, helping you to unlock its key features, including assigning your profile picture for visibility across numerous onchain apps like Bankless Academy.\n\nThe process is very similar to registering a .com website address on a platform like GoDaddy or Google Domains. It‚Äôs as simple as choosing a unique name and submitting two blockchain transactions.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n**1\\. Create a Crypto Wallet**\n\nTo buy and hold your ENS name, you'll need to set up a wallet if you haven't already done so. Check out our quick guide, [‚ÄòCreating a Crypto Wallet‚Äô](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/creating-a-crypto-wallet), and create your wallet in 5 minutes.\n\n**2\\. Ensure You Have ETH in Your Wallet on the Ethereum Mainnet**\n\nYou can fund your wallet by sending cryptocurrency from a Centralized Exchange, or by using services like [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/en-gb) or [Transak](https://global.transak.com/). As another option, you can also pay for an ENS name using a credit or debit card.\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n**1\\. Open the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains/)** **and connect your wallet.**\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-2297867c.png)\n\n**2\\. Search for and select your desired name.**\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-4d71d393.png)\n\n**3\\. Choose the duration of your registration.**\n\nYou‚Äôll need to periodically renew your ENS name. Be sure to set a reminder in your personal calendar to notify you before it expires.\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-0e183437.png)\n\n**4\\. Select your payment method.**\n\nYou can use the balance in your Ethereum wallet, or pay with a credit/debit card.\n\n**Optional:** Set your domain as your `primary name` during this phase. This means your ENS name and profile picture will be displayed instead of your lengthy wallet address on Bankless Academy, Farcaster and other ENS-supported platforms.\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-91795816.png)\n\n**5\\. Review the upcoming registration steps.**\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-d312b342.png)\n\n**6\\. Start the 60 second timer by signing the first transaction.**\n\nThis first transaction prevents others from `front-running` your registration process.\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-a8bece69.png)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gz4ZTiKop-ncbvPL3yjXz.png?height=1127&width=1440)\n\n**7\\. Wait for the timer to finish.**\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-0f779c34.png)\n\n**8\\. Sign the second transaction.**\n\nThis is the transaction that will secure ownership of your new ENS name, and send it to your wallet.\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-b83971f6.png)\n\n**9\\. Success!**\n\nYour ENS name will now be represented as an `ERC-721` token in your wallet.\n\n![](/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-ea2d6d2a.png)\n\nYou can verify that your ENS name redirects to your wallet address by visiting <https://etherscan.io/> and entering your ENS name in the address search bar; note that this process might take a few minutes. Once this is working, your ENS name is ready to be shared with your friends and plugged into Ethereum apps.\n\nFor more ways to utilize your new ENS name, don't forget to check out the ‚ÄòFrequently Asked Questions‚Äô section below!\n\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy registering your web3 username, you are embracing self-sovereignty on the decentralized web, moving towards a future where you alone own your onchain identity. ENS serves as both your web3 username and wallet address, marking your presence in the digital realm. It integrates seamlessly with onchain apps, reflecting and building your identity with every transaction.\n\nYour onchain identity, once established, is solely under your custody, and it is your responsibility to ensure its renewal. The adoption of ENS is key in shaping a user-empowered internet, free from abuses of authority. With ENS, each interaction on the decentralized web is a testament to your unique onchain persona.\n\n\n---\n\nIt‚Äôs time to take control of your onchain identity, with ENS. We hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this entry in the Explorer‚Äôs Handbook: ‚ÄòRegistering Your Web3 Username‚Äô.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to collect this entry if you want to own a copy for easy reference on your travels, or to support future content at Bankless Academy. Safe travels, Explorer!\n\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### **What is a Primary Name?**\n\nYour `primary name` functions as a nickname for your onchain wallet address, simplifying your complex Ethereum wallet address. By assigning a primary name, you allow various apps to use and display it, along with your profile picture. [Learn more here](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7890756-the-primary-name#)!\n\n### **Can I link my email, website, or social media to my ENS name?**\n\nYes, absolutely! Just as your passport can hold different details about you, your ENS name can link to a variety of personal data. This includes your email, personal website, profile picture, and social media handles.\n\nThese `standard records` allow you to publicly share your contact information in a decentralized way. They‚Äôre stored onchain and accessible via any application that recognizes ENS names.\n\nFor a beginner-friendly guide on setting records for your ENS name and what each type of record could be used for, please refer to this [article](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7890802-set-a-record).\n\n### **How much does it cost to register an ENS Name?**\n\nCurrently, the registration costs for ENS names are set at the following prices:\n\n* Names with 5 or more characters: $5 in ETH per year.\n\n* Names with 4 characters: $160 in ETH per year.\n\n* Names with 3 characters: $640 in ETH per year.\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt include transaction `gas fees` for interacting with the Ethereum Network, which are roughly estimated in the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains/). Additional gas fees are required for onchain data updates like setting `custom records`. Prices for shorter names are higher due to scarcity. Fees deter speculative registrations and support the DAO's development of ENS.\n\n### Can I connect multiple wallet addresses with a single ENS name?\n\nAbsolutely! Your ENS name can either map several wallet addresses to a single ENS name, like 'yourname.eth', or you can sort your addresses into separate subnames to identify the type of cryptocurrency associated with each, like 'ethereum.yourname.eth' or 'bitcoin.yourname.eth'.\n\nYou can set up either option using the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app). For more details, [refer to this guide for step-by-step instructions](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7900302-ens-use-cases)\n\n### Can I use my existing website address as my ENS name?\n\nYes, if you own a website like [web3explorer.com](http://web3explorer.com), you can use this instead of web3explorer.eth. This is thanks to infrastructure co-built by ENS and GoDaddy.\n\nTo learn more, check out ENS Labs‚Äô [blog post](https://blog.ens.domains/post/godaddy-partners-with-ens).\n\n\n---\n\n**Authors**\n\n**[Marcus](https://twitter.com/estmcmxci)** publishes the ENS DAO Newsletter. He researches how surplus revenue generated from protocol fees can subsidize application layer development and other open source infrastructure.\n\n**[Tetranome](https://twitter.com/Tetranome)** is the Content & Design Lead at Bankless Academy, focusing on the learning journey, user interface & experience, and platform artwork.\n\n**Patron**\n\nThis walkthrough is powered by Bankless Academy.",

    "articleContent": "## Key Takeaways\n\n> * Stablecoins are the blockchain equivalent of fiat currency, like the dollar or euro.\n>\n> * Stablecoins are `ERC-20` tokens: they allow DeFi users to quickly move between fiat value, and crypto value, while staying on the blockchain.\n>\n> * There are several categories of stablecoin, each with their own trade-offs and risk profile.\n>\n> * Stablecoins can generate more annual interest than holding fiat in a traditional bank.\n\n## Why Hold Stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins have become a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem, reaching over $140 billion USD in supply value at their 2022 peak. Stablecoins settled over $7 trillion in transaction value that year ‚Äî that‚Äôs \\~0.3% of global USD settlement in 2022.\n\n![](/images/understanding-stablecoins/image-0c080b13.png)\n\nHere‚Äôs why they‚Äôre in demand:\n\n* **Stability:** Holding stablecoins in your self-custody wallet is like holding fiat currency, but on the blockchain. When holding a stablecoin like Circle‚Äôs U.S. dollar (USDC), you can expect it to maintain 1:1 value with the U.S. dollar while the prices of assets like ether and bitcoin fluctuate.\n\n* **Flexibility:** Because this pegged value exists as an ERC-20 token on the blockchain, it‚Äôs easy to move between fiat value and crypto value.\n\n* **Access:** Stablecoins provide access to a range of decentralized financial services, like permissionless borrowing or lending to earn interest.\n\n* **Security:** Cryptography makes it extremely difficult for attackers to capture or forge transactions.\n\nThe way a stablecoin maintains a 1:1 equivalence, or `peg`, to its fiat counterpart is its most important property. Just as fiat currency is only worth the fundamentals that underlie it, a stablecoin peg mechanism dictates the value of your holdings.\n\n## Stablecoin Categories\n\nThere are three common strategies for a stablecoin to maintain its price peg:\n\n* üíµ¬†**Fiat-backed:** 1:1 collateralized by real-world fiat reserves.\n\n* üîó¬†**Crypto-collateralized:** overcollateralized by crypto deposits into DeFi protocols.\n\n* üîÉ¬†**Algorithmic:** fixed supply/demand algorithms that maintain price stability.\n\n### 1\\. Fiat-backed Stablecoins\n\nFiat-backed stablecoins maintain value by issuing a fixed token supply matched by real-world currency reserves. Their on-chain price is maintained via supply/demand economics: few people want to pay more than one real-world dollar for a dollar of on-chain value, so they simply take their trade elsewhere. To meet increased demand, the stablecoin issuer locks up additional fiat and increases the token supply by the same amount.\n\nNotable fiat-backed stablecoins include Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC).\n\nStablecoin issuers generate revenue through various methods. These methods include investing a portion of their fiat reserves in short-term US Treasuries and cash equivalents, as well as employing a mixed revenue model that involves collecting transaction fees and offering lending services.\n\n> **Innovation & Philanthropy through Fiat-Backed Stablecoins: Glo Dollar**\n>\n> The Glo Foundation has introduced an innovative approach when it comes to revenue generation through the creation of [Glo Dollar](https://www.glodollar.org/) (USDGLO), its US dollar-backed stablecoin. Glo Dollar sets itself apart from other stablecoins by directing the interest earned from its reserves towards basic income programs for people in extreme poverty.\n>\n> Holders of USDGLO contribute to this mission by practicing embedded philanthropy. Learn more about Glo Dollar and how it works, [here](https://www.glodollar.org/articles/how-glo-works).\n\nConsiderations when using fiat-backed stablecoins:\n\n* **Collateral Audits:** Holders need assurance that their stablecoin tokens are matched one-to-one by fiat reserves. Ideally the provider is open to regular audits by independent parties. USDT has historically made it difficult to know the total value of their locked assets. USDC regularly undergoes independent audits, increasing certainty that their reserves equal their token issuance.\n\n* **Censorship Risk:** With both USDC and USDT subject to government investigation, these tokens‚Äô `smart contracts` include a freeze function whereby a user‚Äôs on-chain holdings can be locked in cases of disagreeable activity. This freeze function also applies to tokens held in `non-custodial wallets`.\n\nThe high degree of centralization in the fiat-backed stablecoin sector leaves great room for improvement in holding fiat-pegged value in a crypto-native way.\n\n### 2\\. Crypto-collateralized Stablecoins\n\nCrypto-collateralized stablecoins are a more transparent, decentralized option ‚Äî and these qualities help eliminate certain risks. They maintain a fiat peg through crypto asset reserves. As crypto market volatility influences the total value of these reserves, these stablecoins are overcollateralized ‚Äî sometimes up to 200%! All collateralized assets are viewable on chain, giving users 24/7 access to the real composition of their stablecoins.\n\nThe most notable example in this category is MakerDAO‚Äôs Dai (DAI).\n\n![DAI collateralization breakdown (June 2023) Source: https://makerburn.com/#/rundown](/images/understanding-stablecoins/image-573e657a.png)\n\nConsiderations:\n\n* **Collateral Valuation:** A stablecoin‚Äôs reserves typically consist of crypto, other stablecoins, and even other asset classes. For example, DAI is backed by BTC, ETH, stablecoins, real world assets, and several other minor components. To mitigate the risks of this diverse range of assets, DAI is overcollateralized (at the time of writing). Even if the ETH price was to crash by 20%, DAI would still have [enough collateral](https://daistats.com/) to cover their token. However, further price volatility across its range of assets could begin to erode the peg.\n\n* `Counterparty Risk`: Reliance on multiple asset classes means there‚Äôs a higher chance one of the assets will experience difficulty and affect the value of your holdings. However, you only have fractional exposure to the impact of each individual risk.\n\n* **Governance Risk:** This type of stablecoin and its treasury are managed by a decentralized group of governance voters. This means there are risks of human error, or possible governance capture.\n\n### 3\\. Algorithmic Stablecoins\n\nThese tokens maintain their peg by automatically balancing their own supply. An onchain algorithm reduces the number of tokens in circulation when the market price falls below the peg, and injects new tokens when the market price surpasses the peg. Both the balancing algorithm and the stablecoin's smart contracts are public, meaning anyone can clone and improve, or audit the existing system.\n\nAs algorithmic stablecoins have the fewest external dependencies, and no administration or governance demands, they almost entirely eliminate counterparty risk. This makes them the most decentralized and self-custody-ready stablecoin option.\n\nNotable examples include Liquity (LUSD) and Frax (FRAX).\n\n![](/images/understanding-stablecoins/image-4f6e4c7f.png)\n\nConsiderations:\n\n* **Dynamic Holdings:** With the balancing algorithm adjusting token supply, your number of tokens held will fluctuate with supply adjustments. The total value of your token holdings remains constant ‚Äî you aren‚Äôt losing or gaining any value ‚Äî but this aspect can be confusing for new users.\n\n* **Highly Technical:** You need to understand the technology to build confidence and risk/reward awareness.\n\n* **Emergent Tech Risk:** With algorithmic stablecoins being so new, unknown smart contract risks could be present. Only use algorithmic stablecoins with several smart contract audits, performed by top-level auditors.\n\n## Choosing a Stablecoin\n\nWhat is the best stablecoin to hold? As with everything DeFi, the answer to that question depends on your **needs**, **values**, and **risk tolerance**.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick refresher on each category:\n\n* üíµ¬†**Fiat-backed:** The traditional approach ‚Äî the closest you‚Äôll come to holding fiat on chain.\n\n  * Values: Conventionality, institutional trust.\n\n  * Risks: Opaque collateral backing, ability for provider to freeze funds.\n\n* üîó¬†**Crypto-collateralized:** A balanced, crypto-native approach, spreading collateral risk across multiple asset classes.\n\n  * Values: Diversification, transparency, progression.\n\n  * Risks: Crypto market volatility, dependence on other assets.\n\n* üîÉ¬†**Algorithmic:** The decentralized ‚Äî but experimental ‚Äî option that minimizes counterparty risk.\n\n  * Values: Self-sovereignty, transparency, progression.\n\n  * Higher risk of smart contract bugs.\n\nAs always, the best way to learn about something is to try it. You might even decide to hold a variety of stablecoins.\n\nAnd remember, not all stablecoins in each category are created equal! Do your own research before interacting with any new token.\n\n\n---\n\nWe hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this entry in the Explorer‚Äôs Handbook: ‚ÄòUnderstanding Stablecoins‚Äô.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to collect this entry if you want to own a copy for easy reference on your travels, or to support future content at Bankless Academy.

This concept says that the longer something has existed, the more we can expect it will continue to exist. Ten years of cryptocurrency history have shown this to only be true on occasion.\n\n### Where can I buy stablecoins?\n\nCentralized Exchanges (CEXs) offer popular fiat-backed stablecoins (and typically their own branded stablecoin), other types of stablecoin are often missing.\n\nVisit a Decentralized Exchange (DEX), or use a direct wallet on-ramp service like ‚ÄòMetaMask Buy‚Äô, to acquire crypto-collateralized and algorithmic tokens. Check out our lesson on [Decentralized Exchanges](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/decentralized-exchanges) to learn more about peer-2-peer marketplaces.\n\n### How can I earn interest on stablecoins?\n\nSome CEXs offer yield by just holding stablecoins on their platform, funded by a share of platform profits to incentivize platform use.\n\nYou can also earn interest in DeFi, with trustless lending and borrowing platforms. These platforms connect lenders and borrowers, managing risk through onchain collateral and smart contracts. Stablecoin lenders can earn annual returns far higher than available in the traditional banking sector ‚Äî but where there‚Äôs reward, there‚Äôs risk!\n\nThe lending and borrowing topic deserves its own Bankless Academy entry. If you‚Äôre already interested in learning more you can research platforms like [Aave.com](https://aave.com/) and [Curve.fi](https://curve.fi/).\n\n### What happens if a stablecoin loses its peg?\n\nThe price of any stablecoin can shift slightly (usually around the +/- 2% mark) in peak network hours. This effect is usually temporary, with prices quickly stabilized by traders taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.\n\nHowever, there are cases where a stablecoin loses its peg beyond safe, temporary ranges. This effect isn‚Äôt necessarily permanent (USDC, March 2023) ‚Äî but it can be (Terra, May 2022).\n\nSome fiat-backed stablecoin issuers, like USDC, offer 1:1 redemption from their stablecoin to regular fiat through their website. Whether this remains true during times of crisis is another story.\n\n\n---\n\n**Author**\n\n**[Tetranome](https://twitter.com/tetranome)** is the Project Champion at Bankless Academy, focusing on user experience, UI, design, and platform curriculum.\n\n**Editor**\n\n**[Trewkat](https://twitter.com/trewkat)**¬†is a writer and editor at BanklessDAO.

For example, a USDC/ETH pool facilitates all trades between this <code>token pair</code> on the host platform.<br>When there are more tokens, users making trades through the pool have less impact on the 50/50 asset balance, which helps prices remain stable.

While the automation of DEX and AMM technology has reduced the cost for exchanging cryptocurrency, interacting with the blockchain is not free of charge. Let‚Äôs take a look at five common costs to consider when deciding which platform to use.</p><p>üè∑Ô∏è <strong>Platform fees:</strong> Approximately 0.5% commission on each trade for most CEXs, and 0.05% for most DEXs. These can fluctuate.</p><p>üåê <strong>Network fees:</strong> Blockchains charge gas fees on top of the dApp transaction. You can minimize these costs by using the network during low periods of activity. Etherscan.io has a real-time estimate tool for various Ethereum Mainnet actions here: <a href='https://etherscan.io/gastracker'>Etherscan.io</a> (for DEXs, refer to the ‚ÄòSwap‚Äô action). On Layer 2s, fees are far cheaper: <a href='https://l2fees.info/'>l2fees.info</a></p><p>üì¶ <strong>Bridge fees:</strong> Both CEXs and the blockchain will charge a flat rate for transferring cryptocurrency from one blockchain network to another. For CEXs, refer to their on-site information. For the blockchain, check out the ‚ÄòDeposit‚Äô action on <a href='https://etherscan.io/gastracker'>Etherscan.io</a>.</p><p>üíπ <strong>Exchange rates:</strong> When buying cryptocurrency directly with fiat on a CEX or DEX, be wary of exchange rates that don‚Äôt reflect the market rate.</p><p>üßä <strong>Slippage:</strong> As prices change so quickly in this space, DEXs leave room for fluctuations on a swap ‚Äî this is called <code>slippage</code>. This percentage value is customizable, with most dApps recommending 0.5-2%. You may lose up to the slippage value on a trade to have it executed, but if your slippage range is too low the trade might be rejected.</p><p>As you can see, there are many factors to consider when comparing exchange fees.

    "articleContent": "## Key Takeaways\n\n> * Decentralized Exchanges are a type of dApp that facilitate self-custody token swaps.\n>\n> * There is some practical knowledge required for confidently interacting with a DEX.\n>\n> * We can use block explorers to inspect our on-chain transactions.\n\nThe Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is the most commonly used application in the world of `Decentralized Finance` (DeFi) ‚Äî and for good reason! DEXs enable automated swapping of one cryptocurrency token for another, without need for a mediator. Unlike Centralized Exchanges (CEXs), this type of swap also enables users to swap while retaining full ownership of their assets.\n\nAutonomy, and permissionless protocols, are backbone features of DeFi. They empower DeFi users with true ownership over their digital assets, and open access to fundamental blockchain services 24/7. Anyone with an internet connection can access DeFi, regardless of their personal background, beliefs, or geographical location.\n\nIn this handbook entry, we will cover how to use your self-custody wallet to interact with a DEX, with the goal of swapping one token for another. You can learn more about the mechanics, qualities, and risk profile of this technology, and how it compares to CEXs, in our lesson on [Decentralized Exchanges](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/decentralized-exchanges).\n\n## Choosing a DEX\n\nSelecting an affordable and safe platform is the first step in performing a token swap. In this walkthrough we will be using Velodrome, the most popular DEX on the Optimism network (at time of writing). As you become more confident in blockchain navigation, you‚Äôll learn how to evaluate other exchanges and find the best fit for your needs. Our [Decentralized Exchanges](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/decentralized-exchanges) lesson includes a comprehensive list of qualities to look out for.\n\n![](/images/swapping-on-a-decentralized-exchange/image-a5b39b1d.png)\n\nDEXs are a great start to your web3 journey because most dApps follow a user interface layout similar to DEXs, and use similar interactions with your self-custody wallet.\n\nLet‚Äôs begin our token swap.\n\n## Performing a Token Swap\n\n**1\\. Load the dApp:**\n\nOpen [Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/swap?from=eth&to=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042) in a new browser tab.\n\n**2\\. Connect your wallet:**\n\nUse the standard ‚ÄòConnect‚Äô button typically located in the top right corner of any dApp.\n\nIf you are on desktop, connect with your browser wallet.\n\nIf you are on mobile, you will be prompted to use WalletConnect ‚Äî the web3 standard for connecting mobile wallets to dApps.\n\n![](/images/swapping-on-a-decentralized-exchange/image-1d7c44d3.png)\n\n**3\\. Approve the connection:**\n\nSelect ‚ÄòConnect‚Äô in your wallet application to confirm the site connection. This allows the dApp to see your wallet address and token balances. You haven‚Äôt granted any other permissions yet.\n\n![](/images/swapping-on-a-decentralized-exchange/image-6ecdef56.png)\n\n**4\\. Check and sign the terms of service (if you accept):**\n\nMany dApps will ask you to sign a message to confirm you have read their terms and conditions. Signing messages doesn‚Äôt cost gas, and doesn‚Äôt store any information on the blockchain. If you agree with the terms, you can sign the message.\n\n![](/images/swapping-on-a-decentralized-exchange/image-e3f7c7e8.png)\n\n**5\\. Switch to the right network:**\n\nFor this walkthrough, make sure your wallet is set to the Optimism network.\n\n![](/images/swapping-on-a-decentralized-exchange/image-8d15c6f6.png)\n\n**6\\. Customize your swap:**\n\nIt‚Äôs time to select your desired input and output tokens. In this example, we will be swapping ETH for OP ‚Äî but you can swap whatever tokens you like!\n\n![](/images/swapping-on-a-decentralized-exchange/image-7b117655.png)\n\n**7\\. Approve token permissions:**\n\nYou will be prompted to set and approve permission for Velodrome to access your wallet funds. We recommend limiting this to your trade size to limit future interactions with your tokens. (Stay tuned for future content on token permissions!)\n\n**8\\. Confirm the transaction:**\n\nOnce you‚Äôre happy with your swap quote and settings, you can begin the swap. This step includes confirming on the dApp, and again in your wallet.\n\n![](/images/swapping-on-a-decentralized-exchange/image-89f87156.png)\n\n**9\\. Check your balance:**\n\nYour transaction should take around 40 seconds to confirm, after which you will see your new token balance in your wallet. If your token type is not displayed, make sure you‚Äôve imported the token addresses.\n\n*Optimism token contract address: 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042*\n\n![](/images/swapping-on-a-decentralized-exchange/image-c8b8abcc.png)\n\n**10\\. Fetch your transaction hash:**\n\nTo complete the quest for our [Decentralized Exchanges](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/decentralized-exchanges) lesson, you‚Äôll need the ***transaction hash of the swap*** (not to be confused with the hash from your token permission transaction, or your wallet address). A block explorer link will usually appear on the DEX interface, letting you view the confirmed transaction details.. If you missed it, or it‚Äôs missing, you‚Äôll find another link in your wallet activity log ‚Äî tied directly to your trade.\n\n![](/images/swapping-on-a-decentralized-exchange/image-bcfdf0ee.png)\n\n\n---\n\nIt‚Äôs time to explore the world of decentralized trading!

Safe travels, Explorer!\n\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Why does my price quote change a few times every minute?\n\nPrice quotes are typically calculated at the time you enter your desired swap into the DEX interface. As time goes by, other users are making swaps and affecting token supply on the exchange. The DEX will regularly refresh your quote to stay up to date.\n\n### How long does it take for a token swap to execute?\n\nThe answer depends on a variety of factors, primarily the block speed of the blockchain and how much you underpay or overpay the gas fee. DEX transactions submitted to Ethereum Mainnet typically take between 15 seconds and a couple of minutes to be confirmed. Layer 2 transactions are usually faster!\n\n### Why did my transaction fail?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why a transaction could fail: insufficient funds to pay gas, gas limit set too low, or slippage set too low. The best way to begin troubleshooting is to look for User Interface error messages. You can also view your transaction on a block explorer, like [Etherscan](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/), to check if there are any on-chain error messages. We‚Äôll cover more troubleshooting specifics in future content!\n\n### Can I change or remove token permissions?\n\nGranting token permissions to a smart contract can leave our wallet vulnerable to unwanted future interactions, in the case of a smart contract hack. It is possible to change or remove token permissions using apps like [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash/). As adjusting permissions costs gas, this precaution can quickly become expensive. This is one of the reasons why many users store their digital assets in one wallet (cold wallet), while interacting with dApps on another (trading wallet). Users transfer assets between them only as necessary.\n\n### Why is the token I'm looking for not available to swap?\n\nIf your token isn‚Äôt listed by default, you‚Äôll have to paste the token contract address into the list. To find the token contract address, check <https://www.coingecko.com/> or the official project website.\n\n**Note:** Token addresses can change for a given token on different networks. For example the [USDC contract on Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48) is different than the [USDC contract on Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x7f5c764cbc14f9669b88837ca1490cca17c31607). Always verify token addresses before swapping!\n\n\n---\n\n**Author**\n\n**[Tetranome](https://twitter.com/tetranome)** is the Project Champion at Bankless Academy, focusing on user experience, UI, design, and platform curriculum.\n\n**Editor**\n\n**[Trewkat](https://twitter.com/trewkat)** is a writer and editor at BanklessDAO.

Check out [the full lesson](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/staking-on-ethereum) to **level up your knowledge and claim your badge!**\n\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n> * Staking is essential to decentralization and transaction processing on Ethereum.\n>\n> * It‚Äôs simple: lock Ether on the network, earn rewards.\n>\n> * Running a `validator node` is the fundamental form of staking on Ethereum, requiring 32 Ether.\n>\n> * Using the rETH `token`, Explorers can get involved in staking with any amount of Ether.\n\n## What is Staking?\n\nPut simply, staking on Ethereum is an action that allows anyone to help secure the network. You lock a portion of Ether on the network, aiding network validators, and earning rewards.\n\nStaking is an essential part of Ethereum‚Äôs `consensus mechanism`: the separation of legitimate transaction and blocks from the fraudulent ones, in a `decentralized` way. This sorting is integral for maintaining a fair economy across the network.\n\nThis might sound familiar ‚Äî because it has the same goal as mining does on the Bitcoin network. Yet there‚Äôs a crucial difference between mining and staking: On Ethereum, staking can be accessed by anyone. You don‚Äôt need a powerful computer to process transactions, like you would for mining on Bitcoin.\n\nSo by simply buying Ether and locking it in a network `smart contract`, you can become a staker. In doing so, you‚Äôll help keep Ethereum running smoothly, and earn rewards in return!\n\n## Start Staking with rETH\n\nNow, the best way to get involved in securing Ethereum is to run a `validator node`. It grants the most rewards, and has the biggest impact on network decentralization. The problem is‚Ä¶ it requires 32 ETH, some technical knowledge, and a dedicated computer with 24/7 power and internet access. That‚Äôs a tall order for most Explorers. Fortunately, innovators within the Ethereum community have created an easy entry point that anyone can use to get involved: `staking pools` and `liquid staking tokens` (LSTs).\n\nRocket Pool is a leader in this category, with an approach granting high positive network impact. By locking Ether in one of their staking pools, you‚Äôll `mint` rETH. While minting rETH directly from the Rocket Pool smart contract has the largest impact on network decentralization, you can also buy it on a `decentralized exchange`. In holding this token, you‚Äôll begin earning staking rewards, generating annual returns between 3% and 16%.\n\nWith rETH, staking rewards are added straight to the value of the token: If you hold 1 rETH today, you will still own 1 rETH in a year. It will just be worth more.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* You‚Äôll need some regular ETH on one of the following networks: Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum or Polygon (POS).\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n### Option #1: Minting New rETH\n\nRequires >0.01 ETH, and only works on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n**1\\. Head over to <https://stake.rocketpool.net/> and connect your wallet.**\n\n![](/images/staking-ether/image-80cf7889.png)\n\n**2\\. Enter the amount you‚Äôd like to stake, hit ‚ÄòStake‚Äô, and then in your wallet hit ‚ÄòSubmit‚Äô.**\n\nYour rETH will land in your wallet once your transaction has been processed. It‚Äôs that easy.\n\n![](/images/staking-ether/image-255e1bf8.png)\n\n### Option #2: Buying rETH on a Decentralized Exchange\n\nNo minimum balance requirements, and works on all networks listed above.\n\n**1\\. Jump to <https://app.uniswap.org/swap> and connect your wallet.**\n\nWe‚Äôre swapping on the Optimism `layer 2` network, because gas fees are a lot lower than on Ethereum mainnet. Learn how to bridge to Optimism, [in our ‚ÄúHow to Fund Your Wallet on L2‚Äù article](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/funding-a-wallet-on-layer-2).\n\n![](/images/staking-ether/image-8d944152.png)\n\n**2\\. Enter the amount you‚Äôd like to hold, hit ‚ÄòSwap‚Äô, and then in your wallet hit ‚ÄòConfirm‚Äô.**\n\nYour rETH will land in your wallet once your transaction has been processed. It‚Äôs that easy.\n\n![](/images/staking-ether/image-5d667f3c.png)\n\n\n---\n\n**It‚Äôs time to become a guardian of Ethereum!** We hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this entry in the Explorer‚Äôs Handbook: ‚Äò‚ÄôStaking Ether‚Äù.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to collect this entry if you want to own a copy for easy reference on your travels, and to support future content at Bankless Academy.\n\nSafe travels, Explorer!\n\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What are the risks of staking?\n\nIt depends on the method used, but the one shared risk is that the validator nodes you‚Äôre involved with could get slashed. In most staking pools and centralized exchange staking, these kinds of losses are diluted across the entire platform (everyone shares the loss, diminishing its impact) or even insured.\n\nOther risks include:\n\n* `Solo Staking`: A bug in the validator node‚Äôs chosen `validator client` software.\n\n* `Staking Pools`: A bug in the staking pool‚Äôs smart contracts, or the validator client software.\n\n* `Centralized Exchange Staking`: Sudden bankruptcy of the exchange, and loss of any stake in it.\n\nThe potential impact of each risk is really difficult to predict, but it‚Äôs safe to say that staking Ether is more risky than simply holding it. Where there‚Äôs reward, there‚Äôs risk! Only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose.\n\n### Does all staking benefit Ethereum?\n\nBenefit comes in the form of `decentralization` ‚Äî you want as many independent `node operators` as possible.\n\n* `Solo Staking`: Maximum decentralization, as this typically means just a few nodes under one person.\n\n* `Staking Pools`: It depends on the platform. Some staking providers only allow specific people to act as validator nodes within their pools. That means many nodes under a few people ‚Äî a centralizing force. Rocket Pool is one of the few providers that allow anyone to become the node operator of a staking pool. This makes their platform one of the best staking options for citizens of Ethereum.\n\n* `Centralized Exchange Staking`: Much like the centralizing forces within staking pools, many nodes under one entity is bad for Ethereum.\n\n### Do staking rewards change?\n\nYes, rewards depend on two key factors:\n\n* **Network Activity:** Generally speaking, in times of low traffic rewards are lower, and in high traffic they‚Äôre higher.\n\n* **Number of Validator Nodes:** With more participants, rewards are further divided.\n\nRewards also change based on the staking method chosen. Check out our¬†[‚ÄúStaking on Ethereum‚Äù lesson](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/staking-on-ethereum)¬†to learn more!\n\n### How do I run a validator node?\n\nIf you want to become a `solo staker`, you‚Äôll need the full 32 ETH, as well as your validator hardware. Check out [this great guide by CoinCashew](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet).\n\nYou can get started with just 16 ETH by running a `staking pool` with Rocket Pool, where other participants will help you reach the 32 ETH required. Of course, you‚Äôll still need your validator hardware.

    "articleContent": "## Key Takeaways\n\n> * Token allowances refer to permissions granted to `smart contracts` to spend tokens from a wallet without further approval.\n>\n> * They can be exploited by malicious actors if the user is not aware permissions are in place.\n>\n> * Tools like Revoke.cash allow users to easily inspect and revoke token allowances.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDeFi grants users control over their assets, including their `private keys`, offering unprecedented sovereignty and authority over their funds. However, with great power comes greater responsibility, requiring users to take full charge of the safety and management of their assets.\n\nThere are four common categories of¬†scams¬†that DeFi users should be aware of:\n\n* **Seed Phrase Compromise:**¬†Attackers attempt to deceive users into revealing their seed phrases, which would give them unauthorized access to funds. With your seed phrase, an attacker can drain all your funds and continue doing so if you deposit additional funds into the wallet. Unfortunately, there is no way to recover from this situation, and the only solution is to create a completely new wallet with a new `seed phrase`.\n\n* **Direct ETH Transfers:**¬†Scammers can conceal ETH transfers by either requesting an ‚Äúeth_sign‚Äù signature or disguising it as a function call, such as ‚ÄúSecurity Update.‚Äù Falling for this scam means you won‚Äôt be able to recover your funds, but you can still safely use your wallet for other transactions.\n\n* **NFT Marketplace Listings:**¬†Be cautious of fake listings and malicious contracts that exploit the allowances you grant to marketplaces like OpenSea. Scammers may trick you into signing an `offchain` message that lists your approved `NFTs` for sale, with no actual token transaction taking place.\n\n* **Token Allowances:**¬†Attackers may manipulate permissions to gain access to more funds than initially approved. ‚ÄúApprovals‚Äù are on-chain transactions that grant access to your tokens or NFTs. ‚ÄúPermits‚Äù offer the same access but only require an off-chain signature.\n\n  As smart contracts gain popularity,¬†`token allowances` become necessary to enable trusted contracts to execute transactions without exposing private keys. Token allowances allow dApps to automatically move tokens in your wallet on your behalf. While this convenience boosts efficiency, it also exposes users to potential attack vectors through scams and unauthorized access.\n\nIn this article, we‚Äôll discuss ‚ÄòToken Allowances‚Äô and introduce a community tool built to help manage your permissions.\n\n## Token Allowances: Understanding, Managing, and Ensuring Safety\n\nToken allowances are permissions given in advance to smart contracts to spend tokens from a wallet. They serve a crucial role in facilitating transactions without requiring explicit permission every time for direct asset transfers from the wallet. When misused, however, token allowances can become an attack vector for the unsuspecting. To address this risk, it‚Äôs important that DeFi users exercise caution,¬†educate themselves on the security landscape,¬†and understand how token allowances actually work.\n\nThere are two steps involved when granting permissions to a third-party contract:\n\n1. Wallet permission: When connecting your wallet to a dApp, you grant its smart contract permission to access your wallet‚Äôs `public key`, view your balances, and monitor your wallet activity.\n\n2. Token approval: Once you‚Äôve granted this access to your wallet, you then approve your tokens to be moved on your behalf in order to complete transactions.\n\nBy proactively managing token allowances, users can ensure that no contract withdraws more than the initially specified amount from their wallet. Luckily, there are community tools built to help give DeFi users confidence and peace of mind.\n\n## Walkthrough: Using Revoke.cash\n\n[Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash/) empowers users to easily manage their token allowances through a simple website that helps inspect and monitor allowances given to different dApps. Let‚Äôs walkthrough how you can use this powerful community tool to help you safeguard your assets and take back control of your wallet.\n\n**1\\. Connect your wallet**:\n\nTo begin the process of revoking your token allowances, head to¬†[Revoke.cash](http://revoke.cash/)¬†and click on ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù located in the top-right corner. Alternatively, you can manually enter your¬†wallet public address¬†in the search bar. Once the loading is complete, you‚Äôll see a list of all your token approvals on that network.\n\n![](/images/managing-token-allowances/image-f95ea594.png)\n\n**2\\. Inspect your allowances**:\n\nOnce you have connected your wallet, you can inspect your existing approvals. You can sort, filter, or search for specific approvals based on the authorized spender address. Sorting by ‚ÄúNewest to Oldest‚Äù is particularly useful if you suspect a malicious approval recently. Use the network selection, sorting, and filtering options provided to gain an overview of token allowances you have granted across various networks.\n\n![](/images/managing-token-allowances/image-f3b00f4a.png)\n\n**3\\. Revoke undesired allowances:**\n\nOnce you identify the approvals you want to revoke, simply click the ‚ÄúRevoke‚Äù button next to each of them.¬†Optionally, you can update the approval to a different amount by clicking the pencil icon next to the approved amount if you still require the approval in the future but wish to reduce your risk.\n\n![](/images/managing-token-allowances/image-138cb12e.png)\n\nIt might be in your best interest¬†to revoke or adjust a token allowance if:\n\n1. A recently deployed smart contract is exploited and creates a vulnerability in a `decentralized exchange` you regularly use.\n\n   Earlier this year, popular `DEX` SushiSwap suffered a similar exploit, when \\~$3.5M was stolen from users. Affected users remained at risk if they hadn‚Äôt revoked their token allowance.\n\n2. A malicious governance proposal updates several contracts with the intent of draining users‚Äô funds.\n\n   More than $2.5M in assets were compromised when Atlantis Loans, a `DeFi` protocol on a BNB chain, executed a governance proposal that targeted several contracts. Users who managed their approval limit mitigated the risk of their wallets being fully drained by the malicious proposal.\n\n\n---\n\nIt‚Äôs time to strengthen our wallet defenses!

Safe travels, Explorer!\n\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n### When should I use Revoke.cash?\n\nUse Revoke.cash periodically, especially during periods when you are not actively using a dApp, particularly for NFT marketplaces. Limiting approvals lessens the risk of funds loss due to hacks, exploits, or phishing scams. By sorting your approvals to show the most recent, you can identify the suspicious approvals and revoke them promptly, mitigating further damage.\n\n### Does disconnecting my wallet protect me from approval exploits?\n\nDisconnecting your wallet from a dApp does not protect you from exploits, approvals or otherwise. The token approvals you previously granted remain active even after disconnecting, because they are stored onchain.\n\n### How can I avoid token allowance exploits and similar risks?\n\nA proactive approach to token allowances includes:\n\n* granting allowances only to trusted dApps.\n\n* periodically reviewing token allowances.\n\n* removing unnecessary or suspicious allowances.\n\n* staying informed about dApps‚Äô security updates.\n\nConsider using third-party tools like the Revoke.cash [browser extension](https://revoke.cash/extension) ‚Äî it acts as a proactive measure against potential threats. The extension warns you if you are about to sign something potentially harmful, protecting you from phishing scams or other malicious activities.\n\n### Can I recover funds with Revoke.cash?\n\nUnfortunately, Revoke.cash cannot recover stolen funds. It serves as a preventive tool to reduce the likelihood of becoming a victim of approval exploits. However, revoking the approvals used to steal your funds can prevent further theft.\n\n### Why does my wallet keep getting drained each time I top it up?\n\nYour wallet may contain a ‚Äúsweeper bot,‚Äù a script that monitors and acts on transactions from a compromised wallet. When it detects such transactions, the bot initiates a new transaction before the original one completes, allowing it to rapidly transfer any new deposits out. If your wallet has such a ‚Äúsweeper bot‚Äù stealing incoming ETH, it means your seed phrase is compromised. Revoking approvals won‚Äôt improve your wallet‚Äôs security. The best course of action is to abandon the compromised wallet and create a new one.\n\n\n---\n\n**Author**\n\n**[Marcus](https://twitter.com/estmcmxci)** publishes the ENS DAO Newsletter.

The farther you travel, the more gas your car uses. Likewise, the more computations you do, the more gas your code requires. Gas price is measured in very small amounts of Ether called <code>gwei</code>, like cents to a dollar. 1 gwei is 1 billionth of an ether (1 gwei = 0.00000001 ETH). </p><p>Total gas cost is based on how much gas your transaction uses and the unit price of gas at the time of use. The formula for calculating the price of a transaction is as follows:<br><em>Amount of gas used * Gas price = Total gas cost</em></p><p>As an example, let‚Äôs say gas costs are at 22 gwei per gas unit and the transaction uses 120-thousand units:<br><em>120,000 * 22 gwei = 2,640,000 gwei </em><em><strong>or</strong></em><em> 0.00264 ETH</em></p></div><div class=\"bloc2\"><img src='/images/dex-aggregators/how-gas-cost-is-calculated-on-ethereum-c7d692cd.svg'></div>"

    "articleContent": "## **Key Takeaways**\n\n> * Ethereum `token` standards are predefined rules and functions used for deploying tokens on Ethereum.\n>\n> * The most popular Ethereum token standards are `ERC-20`, `ERC-721`, and `ERC-1155`.\n>\n> * Each standard enables different levels of `fungibility`, allowing creation of both common and unique onchain assets.\n>\n> * Token standards enable token interoperability across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it very easy for dApps to integrate new tokens, and for you to have access to them!\n\n## What are Ethereum Token Standards?\n\nEthereum hosts tens of thousands of different crypto tokens, each with different properties and use cases. How can the network ensure seamless token support across its dApp ecosystem, without developers having to spend hours integrating each token? How can users of these tokens understand their key properties without scrolling through hours of documentation?\n\nEnter token standards!\n\nThese templates and rulesets support token `interoperability` across the Ethereum ecosystem. This means that dApps only need to support a few common token standards rather than thousands of individual tokens. For Explorers like yourself, this means that you can look at a token‚Äôs founding standard and understand its basic abilities across Ethereum.\n\nToken standards dictate:\n\n* How a token‚Äôs smart contract should be coded.\n\n* The use cases a token can have within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum has three commonly used token standards:\n\n![](/images/understanding-ethereum-token-standards/image-eb8638eb.png)\n\n1. **ERC-20** ‚Äî A standard for easily exchangeable (or fungible) tokens.\n\n   e.g. USDC and UNI tokens.\n\n2. **ERC-721** ‚Äî A standard for unique (or non-fungible) tokens, known as `NFTs`.\n\n   e.g. CryptoPunk and Bored Ape NFTs.\n\n3. **ERC-1155** ‚Äî A standard used for both fungible and non-fungible tokens in the same contract.\n\n   e.g. Items inside a web3 video game.\n\nNow, you are probably wondering: ‚ÄúWhat exactly is fungibility?‚Äù\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at this concept from traditional economics to understand its importance in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n## Fungibility vs. Non-Fungibility.\n\n**‚ÄòFungibility‚Äô** is a property of an economic asset or good, indicating two key features:\n\n* When the asset is traded, its units are interchangeable without any alteration in value.\n\n  ($1 USD can be exchanged for another $1 USD, or four 25¬¢ coins, or twenty 5¬¢ coins.)\n\n* When the asset is divided, the smaller fractions maintain its fundamental characteristics.\n\n  ($1 USD, split into four 25¬¢ coins, still functions as a store of value or is used for making purchases.)\n\nExamples of fungible assets include oil, fiat currency, government bonds, and company shares. These non-unique assets can be easily exchanged and divided.\n\n![](/images/understanding-ethereum-token-standards/image-8e5e9468.png)\n\nConversely, **‚Äònon-fungibility‚Äô** indicates:\n\n* The asset has unique properties which make it distinguishable from its counterparts, giving it a unique value.\n\n  (A canvas painting by Van Gogh is priced differently to one by an emerging modern artist, because of the appearance, rarity, level of skill, and reputation behind the paintings.)\n\n* The act of division affects its fundamental characteristics.\n\n  (A painting cut into four pieces has sections that do not resemble one another, and each section may be valued differently. The initial intention of the painting is also gone.)\n\nSome examples of non-fungible assets are real estate, artwork, digital identities, and certifications. These assets are more difficult to exchange and divide because of their unique properties.\n\n![](/images/understanding-ethereum-token-standards/image-ebe8683a.png)\n\nIf you‚Äôre ever confused about fungibility, just ask yourself: ‚ÄúHow easy is it to exchange and divide?‚Äù If it‚Äôs difficult, it‚Äôs likely non-fungible!\n\nEthereum aims to become ‚Äúthe settlement layer for the world economy‚Äù. Fungible and non-fungible asset functionality opens opportunities for traditional asset classes to be represented onchain ‚Äî and for new ones to be created!\n\n## Standards & Token Functions\n\nWhen deploying a new token contract on Ethereum, the asset creator will select from one of the existing token standards. This grants it initial properties ‚Äî called functions ‚Äî such as the total supply of the asset, whether or not it can be transferred to another wallet, and what information it can hold.\n\n![](/images/understanding-ethereum-token-standards/image-242de5f5.png)\n\nFor example, ERC-20 uses functions like these:\n\n**1\\. totalSupply:** Defines the total supply of an ERC-20 token.\n\nThe total supply of a token informs important qualities like its value and distribution.\n\n**2\\. balanceOf:** Checks the token balance of a specified address.\n\nThis helps services and platforms check your wallet‚Äôs balance before executing your requested transaction.\n\n**3\\. transfer:** Transfers tokens from your address to other addresses.\n\nEvery time you send a crypto token from your wallet to another wallet, you‚Äôre using the transfer function.\n\n**4\\. approve:** Allows an address (usually a smart contract) to automatically transact on behalf of your wallet up to a specified amount.\n\nUsing this function, you can approve a platform or service to automatically use a defined portion of your funds and execute transactions.\n\n**5\\. allowance:** Used to get the amount that a spender can transact from a wallet.\n\nA platform may use this function to check the total amount you‚Äôve approved it to use and if it can execute the transaction without you signing it manually.\n\nStandardizing the token creation process enables `composability` in the Ethereum ecosystem. For instance, a developer building a [decentralized exchange (DEX)](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/decentralized-exchanges) can add support for any token following the ERC-20 standard because they will all behave in a similar way. They will not need to  build in individual support for each listed token.\n\nSimilarly, someone building an NFT marketplace just needs to make the platform compliant with ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards to support all NFTs created on Ethereum.\n\nNow that we understand token standards, fungibility, and functions, let‚Äôs take a look at the use cases for the three primary standards on Ethereum.\n\n### ERC-20: Fungible Tokens\n\n![](/images/understanding-ethereum-token-standards/image-4708764e.png)\n\n[ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) is a token standard that defines the rules for creating fungible token contracts.\n\nERC-20 tokens can be anything from a `memecoin` to a mode of payment in a decentralized marketplace. In most cases, they‚Äôll fit into one of these four categories:\n\n**1\\. Utility token:** Serves a specific use case within an app/platform ecosystem.\n\nExample: Filecoin (FIL) is used to reward storage providers who validate and add new blocks to their data storage network.\n\n**2\\. Governance token:** Offers holders voting rights in governance decisions of a platform.\n\nExample: Ethereum Name Service (ENS) holders can vote in proposals to update the domain registry protocol.\n\n**3\\. Stablecoin:** Designed to maintain a stable value, usually equal to the U.S. dollar.\n\nExamples: Tether (USDT), USDCoin (USDC), DAI (DAI).\n\n**4\\. Security token:** Represents ownership in an underlying asset, like stocks of a company.\n\nExamples: Blockchain Capital (BCAP)\n\nA single token could fall into more than one category. For example, a governance token can also have certain utility within a platform.\n\nYou can easily [buy ERC-20 tokens on a DEX](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/how-to-swap-on-a-decentralized-exchange) like Uniswap or a `centralized exchange` like Binance or Coinbase.\n\n### ERC-721: Non-fungible Tokens\n\n![](/images/understanding-ethereum-token-standards/image-aa1af1d5.png)\n\n[ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) is a standard that defines the rules for Ethereum users to create or use non-fungible tokens. It ensures that each NFT created is provably unique.\n\nWhat are some use cases of ERC-721 tokens?\n\n**1\\. Ownership of assets:** ERC-721 tokens are widely used to represent the ownership of unique digital and real-world assets. For example, this Explorer‚Äôs Handbook entry has 100 individually numbered versions available ‚Äî not just to read, but to own ‚Äî like a book on your digital bookshelf. (You can `mint` and own it by hitting the gold ‚ÄòCollect Entry‚Äô button at the top). Bankless Academy‚Äôs ‚ÄòDatadisk Collectibles‚Äô work in the same way.\n\n**2\\. Subscriptions and memberships:** Creators, artists, clubs, and companies are already using NFTs for subscriptions, event tickets, and memberships. The provable uniqueness of NFTs ensures that each of the fixed supply is tied to an individual user.\n\n**3\\. Loyalty rewards:** Starbucks launched a loyalty program called Odyssey where its members can complete quests to obtain NFTs that they can redeem for digital and real-world rewards. Many other brands are offering NFTs as a loyalty reward that users can choose to redeem or sell whenever they want.\n\n**4\\. Identity and Certifications:** ERC-721 tokens can be used to create tamper-proof identities and certifications. When your digital identity or certificates are ERC-721 tokens, it is easy for you to prove your ownership and nearly impossible for anyone to forge your documents and misuse them.\n\nTo get an ERC-721 token, create an account on an NFT marketplace like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or [Blur](https://blur.io/) and purchase any listed NFT. Make sure you take our [Web3 Security](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/web3-security) lesson to protect yourself from marketplace scams.\n\n### ERC-1155: Fungible & Non-fungible Tokens\n\n![](/images/understanding-ethereum-token-standards/image-d804ad2f.png)\n\nOften referred to as a `multi-token standard`, [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) merges the concepts of ERC-20 and ERC-721 and lets builders write contracts that can support both fungible and non-fungible tokens. This doesn‚Äôt make a major difference to the user experience but can help to optimize platform features. An example would be deploying both a fungible in-game currency and non-fungible in-game assets under a single contract.\n\nThis standard also allows the creation of semi-fungible tokens ‚Äî tokens that are fungible and non-fungible in specific circumstances. For example, in a trading card collection, all cards that have the same rarity might be fungible (interchangeable) whereas cards with differing rarity levels might be non-fungible (non-interchangeable).\n\nERC-1155 also enables batch transactions to send multiple token types at once, potentially reducing the `gas` cost for users.\n\n\n---\n\nWe commend you for making it through this lengthy entry in the Explorer‚Äôs Handbook: ‚ÄòUnderstanding Token Standards‚Äô.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to collect this entry if you want to own a copy for easy reference on your travels, or to support future content at Bankless Academy. Safe travels, Explorer!\n\n\n---\n\n## Ethereum Token Standard FAQ\n\n### How are Ethereum token standards created?\n\nToken standards are proposed and published on Ethereum through a proposal process called Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). Once a proposal is passed, it becomes a standard and is called an Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC). The serial number of the EIP is then appended to complete the standard name, e.g. ERC-20 or ERC-721.\n\n### Does ether (ETH) follow a token standard?\n\nNo. In fact, ETH is known as a ‚Äòcoin‚Äô not a ‚Äòtoken‚Äô, meaning it has its own [blockchain](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/blockchain-basics).\n\n### Can anyone launch a token?\n\nYes. Ethereum is a permissionless ecosystem and anyone can launch a fungible or non-fungible token. However, you will need technical know-how or access to no-code tools.\n\n### If two tokens have the same name, how do I know which is the official token?\n\nTo identify the original token, you should check the contract address that‚Äôs used to publish the tokens you want to use and reference it against official project documentation. This way you‚Äôll ensure that you do not interact with a malicious token contract that could drain your wallet.\n\n### Are there other token standards on Ethereum apart from ERC-20, 721, and 1155?\n\nYes, there are other token standards on Ethereum that are not in use or have very niche use cases. Some examples include [ERC-223](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-223), [ERC-1462](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1462), [ERC-1948](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1948), and [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626).\n\n\n---\n\n**Authors**\n\n**[Musharraf](https://x.com/musharrafff)** is the co-founder of Unhashed.

    "articleContent": "## Key Takeaways\n\n> * Delegation is a voting mechanic that allows a representative ‚Äî called a ‚ÄòDelegate‚Äô ‚Äî to make votes on another person‚Äôs behalf.\n>\n> * Optimism handles voting and delegation via their ‚ÄòOptimism Agora‚Äô `dApp`.\n>\n> * You will maintain self-custody over delegated OP tokens, able to transfer or sell at any time.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDelegation is an onchain voting mechanic that allows a community member to temporarily grant their governance voting power to a community representative. This process allows a user to contribute to `network governance`, without having to actively monitor every proposed action or change in the ecosystem.\n\nOn Optimism, governance power is represented by holding OP tokens in a self-custody wallet. OP tokens do not leave your self-custody wallet during delegation. You can transfer or sell them at any time, but your Delegate will only receive the voting power held in your wallet. You can change your community Delegate at any time.\n\nOn Optimism we use a voting dApp called ‚ÄòAgora‚Äô to look through eligible Delegates, perform delegation, and monitor proposals. Let‚Äôs take a closer look.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nIf you want to hold voting power, you‚Äôll need to purchase OP tokens. You can continue without completing these two steps if you simply want to set up delegation.\n\n**1\\. Buy ETH on the Optimism Network.**\n\nYou can find a step-by-step guide in our Explorer‚Äôs Handbook entry, [‚ÄòHow to fund a Wallet on Layer 2‚Äô](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/how-to-fund-a-wallet-on-layer-2).\n\n**2\\. Swap your ETH to OP tokens on the Optimism Network, using a** `DEX`.\n\nCheck out our Explorer‚Äôs Handbook entry on [‚ÄòHow to Swap on a Decentralized Exchange‚Äô](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/how-to-swap-on-a-decentralized-exchange) for a step-by-step guide on using a DEX to buy OP tokens.\n\n## Delegating on Optimism Agora\n\n**1\\. Open the Optimism Agora dApp: <https://vote.optimism.io/>**\n\n![](/images/delegating-on-optimism/image-ce643a81.png)\n\n**2\\. Connect your wallet.**\n\n![](/images/delegating-on-optimism/image-9ec06fe9.png)\n\n**3\\. Scroll down, and choose your favorite Delegate.**\n\nBy clicking on a delegate, you will find a short statement, their vote history, and influence measurements. Take your time to find a representative that aligns with your vision for Optimism.\n\n![](/images/delegating-on-optimism/image-6443ae02.png)\n\n**4\\. Hit the ‚Äòdelegate‚Äô button, and approve the transaction in your wallet.**\n\nNo OP tokens will leave your wallet throughout this process. There is a small gas fee, charged in ETH.\n\n![](/images/delegating-on-optimism/image-245809cd.png)\n\n\n---\n\nIt‚Äôs time to explore better voting systems. We hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this entry in the Explorer‚Äôs Handbook: ‚ÄòDelegating on Optimism‚Äô.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to collect this entry if you want to own a copy for easy reference on your travels, or to support future content at Bankless Academy. Safe travels, Explorer!\n\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How many tokens do I need to delegate?\n\nYou can begin delegating while holding any amount of OP tokens ‚Äî even zero! As you increase or decrease your OP holdings, your delegated voting power will be updated. You don‚Äôt have to redelegate every time you make changes to your OP holdings.\n\n### How do I choose the right delegate?\n\nIt comes down to your personal values, and your vision for how you want to see Optimism grow. Take some time to scroll through the Delegate profiles and see what resonates with you.\n\n### Can I become a Delegate?\n\nYou can! Check out the [‚ÄòHow to be a delegate‚Äô](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/delegate/) guide, hosted on Optimism Docs.\n\nNote: this won‚Äôt count for the [‚ÄòOptimism Governance‚Äô](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/optimism-governance) lesson quest at Bankless Academy.\n\n### Do I need to delegate to vote?\n\nYou can skip delegation and represent yourself by tracking votes under the ‚ÄòProposals‚Äô tab on Optimism Agora.\n\nNote: this also won‚Äôt count for the [‚ÄòOptimism Governance‚Äô](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/optimism-governance) lesson quest at Bankless Academy, but you can do so once you‚Äôve collected your badge!\n\n\n---\n\n**Author**\n\n**[Tetranome](https://twitter.com/Tetranome)** is the Project Champion at Bankless Academy, focusing on user experience, interface, design, and content.\n\n**Patron**\n\nThis article was funded by **[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)**.",
